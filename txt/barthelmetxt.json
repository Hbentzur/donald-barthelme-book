    "alltxt": "While I read the Journal of Sensory Deprivation, Wanda, my former wife, read Elle. Elle was an incitement to revolt to one who had majored in French in college and now had nothing much to do with herself except take care of a child and look out of the window. Wanda empathizes with the magazine. \"Femmes enceintes, ne mangez pas de bifteck cru!\" Elle once proclaimed, and Wanda complied. Not a shred of bifteck cru passed her lips during the whole period of her pregnancy. She cultivated, as Elle instructed, un petit air naiif, or the schoolgirl look. She was always pointing out to me four-color photographs of some handsome restored mill in Brittany which had been redone with Arne Jacobsen furniture and bright red and orange plastic things from Milan: \"Une Maison Qui Capte la Nature.\" During this period Elle ran something like four thousand separate actualit√© pieces on Anna Karina, the film star, and Wanda actually came to resemble her somewhat.\n\n Our evenings lacked promise. The world in the evening seems fraught with the absence of promise, if you are a married man. There is nothing to do but go home and drink your nine drinks and forget about it.\n\n Slumped there in your favorite chair, with your nine drinks lined up on the side table in soldierly array, and your hand never far from them, and your other hand holding on to the plump belly of the overfed child, and perhaps rocking a bit, if the chair is a rocking chair as mine was in those days, then it is true that a tine tendril of contempt - strike that, content - might curl up from the storehouse where the world's content is kept, and reach into your softened brain and take hold there, persuading you that this, at last, is the fruit of all your labors, which you'd been wondering about in some such terms as, \"Where is the fruit?\" And so, newly cheered and warmed by this false insight, you reach out with your free hand (the one that is not clutching the nine drinks) and pat the hair of the child, and the child looks up into your face, gauging your mood as it were, and says, \"Can I have a horse?\", which is after all a perfectly reasonable request, in some ways, but in other ways is total ruin to that state of six-o'clock equilibrium you have so painfully achieved, because it, the child's request, is of course absolutely out of the question, and so you say \"No!\" as forcefully as possible - a bark rather like a bite - in such a way as to put the quietus on this project, having a horse, once and for all, permanently. But, placing yourself in the child's ragged shoes, which look more like used Brillo pads than shoes now that you regard them closely, you remember that time long ago on the other side of the Great War when you too desired a horse, and so, pulling yourself together, and putting another drink in your mouth (that makes three, I believe), you assume a thoughtful look (indeed, the same grave and thoughtful look you have been wearing all day, to confuse your enemies and armor yourself against the indifference of your friends) and begin to speak to the child softly, gently, cunningly even, explaining that the genus horse prefers the great open voids, where it can roam, and graze, and copulate with other attractive horses, to the confined space of a broken-down brownstone apartment, and that a horse if obtained would not be happy here, in the child's apartment, and does he, the child, want an unhappy horse, moping and brooding, and lying all over the double bed in the bedroom, and perhaps vomiting at intervals, and maybe even kicking down a wall or two, to express its rage? But the child, sensing the way the discussion is trending, says impatiently, with a chop of its tiny little hand, \"No, I don't mean that,\" giving you to understand that it, the child, had not intended what you are arguing against but had intended something else altogether: a horse personally owned by it, the child, but pastured at a stable in the park, a horse such as Otto has - \"Otto has a horse?\" you say in astonishment - Otto being a schoolfellow of the child, and indeed the same age, and no brighter as far as the naked eye can determine but perhaps a shade more fortunate in the wealth dimension, and the child nods, yes, Otto has a horse, and a film of tears is squeezed out and presented to you, over its eyes, and with liberal amounts of anathematization for Otto's feckless parents and the profound hope that the fall of the market has ruined them beyond repair you push the weeping child with its filmic tears off your lap and onto the floor and turn to your wife, who has been listening to all of this with her face turned to the wall, and no doubt a look upon her face corresponding to that which St. Catherine of Siena bent upon poor Pope Gregory whilst reproaching him for the luxury of Avignon, if you could see it (but of course you cannot, as her face is turned to the wall) - you look, as I say, to your wife, as the cocktail hour fades, there being only two drinks left of the nine (and you have sworn a mighty oath never to take more than nine before supper, because of what it does to you), and inquire in the calmest tones available what is for supper and would she like to take a flying fuck at the moon for visiting this outrageous child upon you. She, rising with a regal sweep of her air naiif, and not failing to let you have a good look at her handsome legs, those legs you could have, if you were good, motors out of the room and into the kitchen, where she throws the dinner on the floor, so that when you enter the kitchen to get some more ice you begin skidding and skating about in a muck of pork chops, squash, sauce diable, Danish stainless-steel flatware, and Louis Martini Mountain Red. So, this being the content of your happy hour, you decide to break your iron-clad rule, that rule of rules, and have eleven drinks instead of the modest nine with which you had been wont to stave off the song of twilight, when the lights are low, and the flickering shadows, etc., etc. But, opening the refrigerator, you discover that the slovely bitch has failed to fill up the ice trays so there is no more ice for your tenth and eleventh sloshes. On discovering this you are just about ready to throw in the entire enterprise, happy home, and go to the bordel for the evening, where at least you can be sure that everyone will be kind to you, and not ask you for a horse, and the floor will not be a muck of sauce diable and pork chops. But when you put your hand in your pocket you discover that there are only three dollars there - not enough to cover a sortie to the bordel, where Master Charge is not accepted, so that the entire scheme, going to the bordel, is blasted. Upon making these determinations, which are not such as to bring the hot flush of excitement to the old cheek, you measure out your iceless over-the-limit drinks, using a little cold water as a make-do, and return to what is called the \"living\" room, and prepare to live, for a little while longer in a truce with your circumstances - aware that there are wretches worse off than you, people whose trepanations have not been successful, girls who have not been invited to the sexual revolution, priests still frocked. It is seven-thirty.\n\n I remember once we were sleeping in a narrow bed, Wand and I, in a hotel, on a holiday, and the child crept into bed with us. \"If you insist on overburdening the bed,\" we said, \"you must sleep at the bottom, with the feet.\" \"But I don't want to sleep with the feet\" the child said. \"Sleep with the feet,\" we said, \"they won't hurt you.\" \"The feet kick,\" the child said, \"in the middle of the night.\" \"The feet or the floor,\" we said. \"Take your choice.\" \"Why can't I sleep with the heads,\" the child asked, \"like everybody else?\" \"Because you are a child,\" we said, and the child subsided, whimpering, the final arguments int he case having been presented and the verdict in. But in truth the child was not without recourse, it urinated in the bed, in the vicinity of the feet. \"God damn it,\" I said, inventing this formulation at the instant of need. \"What the devil is happing, at the bottom of the bed?\" \"I couldn't help it,\" the child said. \"It just came out.\" \"I forgot to bring the plastic sheet,\" Wanda said. \"Holy hell,\" I said. \"Is there to be no end to this family life?\"\n I spoke to the child and the child spoke to me and the merest pleasantry trembled with enough animus to bring down an elephant.\n \"Clean your face,\" I said to the child. \"It's dirty.\" \"It's not,\" the child said. \"By God it is,\" I said, \"filth adheres in ine areas which I shall enumerate.\" \"That is because of the dough,\" the child said. \"We were taking death masks.\" \"Dough!\" I exclaimed, shocked at the idea that the child had wasted flour and water and no doubt paper too in this lightsome pastime, taking death masks. \"Death!\" I exclaimed for added emphasis. \"What do you know of death?\" \"It is the end of the world,\" the child said, \"for the death-visited individual. The world ends,\" the child said, \"when you turn out your eyes.\" This was true, I could not dispute it. I returned to the main point. \"Your father is telling you to wash your face,\" I said, locating myself in the abstract where I was more comfortable. \"I know that,\" the child said, \"that's what you always say.\" \"Where are they, the masks?\" I asked. \"Drying,\" the child said, \"on the heaterator\"- its word for radiator. I then went to the place were the heaterator stood and looked. Sure enough, four tiny life masks. My child and three of its tiny friends lay there, grinning. \"Who taught you how to do this?\" I asked, and the child said, \"We learned it in school.\" I cursed the school then, in my mind. It was not the first time I had cursed the school, in my mind. \"Well, what will you do with them?\" I asked, demonstrating an interest in childish projects. \"Hang them on the wall?\" the child suggested. \"Yes, yes, hang them on the wall, why not?\" I said. \"Intimations of mortality,\" the child said, with a sly look. \"Why the look?\" I asked. \"What is that supposed to mean?\" \"Ho ho,\" the child said, sniggering - a palpable snigger. \"Why the snigger?\" I asked, for the look in combination with the snigger had struck fear into my heart, a place where no more fear was needed. \"You'll find out,\" the child said, testing the masks with a dirty finger to determine if they had dried. \"I'll find out!\" I exclaimed. \"What does that mean, I'll find out?\" \"You'll be sorry,\" the child said, with a piteous glance at itself, in the mirror. But I was ahead of him, I was already sorry. \"Sorry!\" I cried, \"I've been sorry all my life!\" \"Not without reason,\" the child said, a wise look replacing the piteous look. I am afraid that a certain amount of physical abuse of the child ensued. But I shall not recount it, because of the shame.\n\n _____\n\n\n \"You can have the seven years,\" I said to Wanda. \"What seven years?\" Wanda asked. \"The seven years by which you will, statistically, outlive me,\" I said. \"Those years will be yours, to do with as you wish. Not a word of reproof or critique will you hear from me, during those years. I promise.\" \"I cannot wait,\" she said. I remember Wanda in the morning. Up in the morning reading the Times I was walked past by Wanda, already sighing although not thirty seconds out of bed. At night I drank and my hostility came roaring out of its cave like a jet-assisted banshee. When we played checkers I'd glare at her so hotly she'd often miss a triple jump.\n\n I remember that I fixed the child's bicycle, once. That brought me congratulations, around the fireside. That was a good, a fatherly thing to do. It was a cheap bicycle, 29.95$ or some such, and the seat wobbled and the mother came home from the park with the bicycle in an absolute fury because the child was being penalized by my penury, in the matter of the seat. \"I will fix it,\" I said. i went to the hardware store and bought a two-and-one-half-inch piece of pipe which I used as a collar around the seat's stem to accommodate the downward thrust. Then I affixed a flexible metal strap about eight inches in length to the back of the seat and then to the chief upright, by means of screws. This precluded side-to-side motion of the seat. A triumph of field expediency. Everyone was loving and kind that night. The child brought me my nine drinks very prettily, setting them on the side table and lining them up with the aid of a meterstick, into a perfect straight line. \"Thank you,\" I aid. We beamed at each other contesting as to who could maintain the beam the longest.\n I visited the child's nursery school once. Fathers were invited seriatim, one father a day. I sat there on a little chair while the children ran to and fro and made sport. I was served a little cake. A tiny child not my own attached herself to me. Her father was in England, she said. She had visited him there and his apartment was full of cockroaches. I wanted to take her home with me.\n\n After the separation, which came about after what is known as the breaking point was reached, Wanda visited me in my bachelor setup. We were drinking healths. \"Health to the child!\" I proposed. Wanda lifted her glass. \"Health to your projects!\" she proposed, and I was pleased. That seemed very decent of her. I lifted my glass. \"Health to the republic!\" I proposed. We drank to that. Then Wanda proposed a health. \"Health to abandoned wives!\" she said. \"Well now,\" I said. \"'Abandoned,' that's a little strong.\" \"Pushed out, jettisoned, abjured, thrown away,\" she said. \"I remember,\" I said, \"a degree of mutuality, in our parting.\" \"And when guests came,\" she said, \"you always made me sit in the kitchen.\" \"I thought you liked it in the kitchen,\" I said. \"You were forever telling me to get out of the bloody kitchen.\" \"And when my overbite required correction,\" she said, \"you would not pay for the apparatus.\" \"Seven years of sitting by the window with your thumb in your mouth,\" I said. \"What did you expect?\" \"And when I needed a new frock,\" she said, \"you hid the Master Charge.\" \"There was nothing wrong with the old one,\" I said, \"that a few well-placed patches couldn't have fixed.\" \"And when we were invited to the Argentine Embassy,\" she said, \"you made me drive the car in a chauffeur's cap, and park the car, and stand about with the other drivers outside while you chatted up the Ambassador.\" \"You know no Spanish,\" I pointed out. \"It was not the happiest of marriages,\" she said, \"all in all.\" \"There has been a sixty percent increase in single-person households in the last ten years, according to the Bureau of the Census,\" I told her. \"Perhaps we are part of a trend.\" That thought did not seem to console her much. \"Health to the child!\" I proposed, and she said, \"We've already done that.\" \"Health to the mother of the child!\" I said, and she said, \"I'll drink to that.\" To tell the truth we were getting a little wobbly on our pins, at this point. \"It is probably not necessary to rise each time,\" I said, and she said, \"Thank God,\" and sat. I looked at her then to see if I could discern traces of what I had seen int he beginning. There were traces but only traces. Vestiges. Hints of a formerly intact mystery never to be returned to its original wholeness. \"I know what you're doing,\" she said, \"you are touring the ruins.\" \"Not at all,\" I said. \"You look very well, considering.\" \"Considering!\" she cried, and withdrew from her bosom an extremely large horse pistol. \"Health to the dead!\" she proposed, meanwhile waving the horse pistol in the air in an agitated manner. I drank that health, but with misgivings, because who was she talking about? \"The sacred dead,\" she said with relish. \"The well-beloved, the well-esteemed, the well-remembered, the well-ventilated.\" She attempted to ventilate me then, with the horse pistol. The barrel wavered to the right of my head, and to the left of my head, and I remember that although its guidance system was primitive its caliber was large. The weapon discharged with a blurt of sound and the ball smashed a bottle of J&B on the mantel. She wept. The place stank of scotch. I called her a cab.\n\n Wanda is happier now, I think. She has taken herself off to Nanterre, where she is studying Marxist sociology with Lefebvre (not impertinently, the author of the Critique de la Vie Quotidienne). The child is being cared for in an experimental nursery school for the children of graduate students run, I understand, in accord with the best Piagetian principles. And I, I have my J&B. The J&B company keeps manufacturing it, case after case, year in and year out, and there is, i am told, no immediate danger of a dearth."

    "title": "Rebecca\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "Rebecca Lizard was trying to change her ugly, reptilian, thoroughly unacceptable last name.\n \"Lizard,\" said the judge. \"Lizard, Lizard, Lizard, Lizard. There's nothing wrong with it if you say it enough times. You can't clutter up the court's calendar with trivial little minor irritations. And there have been far too many people changing their names lately. Changing your name countervails the best interest of the telephone comany, the electric company, and the United States goverment. Motion denied.\"\n Lizard in tears.\n Lizard led from the courtroom. A chrysanthemum of Kleenex held under her nose.\n \"Shaky lady,\" said a man, \"are you a schoolteacher?\"\n Of course she's a schoolteacher, you idiot. Can't you see the poor woman's all upset? Why don't you leave her alone?\n \"Are you a homosexual lesbian? Is that why you never married?\"\n Christ, yes, she's a homosexual lesbian, as you put it. Would you please shut your face?\n Rebecca went to the damned dermatologist (a new damned dermatologist), but he said the same thing the others had said. \"Greenish,\" he said, \"slight greenishness, genetic anomaly, nothing to be done, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lizard.\"\n \"Miss Lizard.\"\n \"Nothing to be done, Miss Lizard.\"\n \"Thank you, Doctor. Can I give you a little something for your trouble?\"\n \"Fifty dollars.\"\n When Rebecca got home the retroactive rent increase was waiting for her, coiled in her mailbox like a pupil about to strike.\nMust get some more Kleenex. Or a Ph.D. No other way.\n She thought about sticking her head in the oven. But it was an electric oven.\n Rebecca's lover, Hilda, came home late.\n \"How'd it go?\" Hilda asked, referring to the day.\n \"Lousy.\"\n \"Hmmm,\" Hilda said, and quietly mixed strong drinks of busthead for the two of them.\n Hilda is a very good-looking woman. So is Rebecca. They love each other--an incredibly dangerous and delicate business, as we know. Hilda has long blond hair and is perhaps a shade the more beautiful. Of course Rebecca has a classic and sexual figure which attracts huge admiration from every beholder.\n \"You're late,\" Rebecca said. \"Where were you?\"\n \"I had a drink with Stephanie.\"\n \"Why did you have a drink with Stephanie?\"\n \"She stopped by my office and said let's have a drink.\"\n \"Where did you go?\"\n \"The Barclay.\"\n \"How is Stephanie?\"\n \"She's fine.\"\n \"Why did you have to have a drink with Stephanie?\"\n \"I was ready for a drink.\"\n \"Stephanie doesn't have a slight greenishness, is that it? Nice, pink Stephanie?\"\n Hilda rose and put an excellent C & W album on the record player. It was David Rogers's \"Farewell to the Ryman,\" Atlantic SD 7283. It contains such favorites as \"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\" \"Great Speckled Bird,\" \"I'm Movin' On,\" and \"Walking the Floor Over You.\" Many great Nashville personnel appear on this record.\n \"Pinkness is not everything,\" Hilda said. \"And Stephanie is a little bit boring. You know that.\" \"Not so boring that you don't go out for drinks with her.\"\n \"I am not interested in Stephanie.\"\n \"As I was leaving the courthouse,\" Rebecca said, \"a man unzipped my zipper.\"\n David Rogers was singing \"Oh please release me, let me go.\"\n \"What were you wearing?\"\n \"What I'm wearing now.\"\n \"So he had good taste,\" Hilda said, \"for a creep.\" She hugged Rebecca, on the sofa. \"I love you,\" she said.\n \"Screw that,\" Rebecca said plainly, and pushed Hilda away. \"Go hang out with Stephanie Sasser.\"\n \"I am not interested in Stephanie Sasser,\" Hilda said for the second time.\n Very often one \"pushes away\" the very thing that one most wants to grab, like a lover. This is a common, although distressing, psychological mechanism, having to do (in my opinion) with the fact that what is presented is not presented \"purely,\" that there is a tiny little canker or grim place in it somewhere. However, worse things can happen.\n \"Rebecca,\" said Hilda, \"I really don't like your slight greenishness.\"\n The term \"lizard\" also includes geckos, iguanas, chameleons, slowworms, and monitors. Twenty existing families make up the order, according to the Larousse Encyclopedia of Animal Life, and four others are known only from fossils. There are about twenty-five hundred species, and they display adaptations for walking, running, climbing, creeping, or burrowing. Many have interesting names, such as the Bearded Lizard, the Collared Lizard, the Flap-Footed Lizard, the Frilled Lizard, the Girdle-Tailed Lizard, and the Wall Lizard.\n \"I have been overlooking it for these several years, because I love you, but I really don't like it so much,\" Hilda said. \"It's slightly--\"\n \"Knew it,\" said Rebecca.\n Rebecca went into the bedroom. The color television set was turned on, for some reason. In a greenish glow, a film called Green Hill was unfolding.\nI'm ill, I'm ill.\n I will become a farmer.\n Our love, our sexual love, our ordinary love!\n Hilda entered the bedroom and said, \"Supper is ready.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"Pork with red cabbage.\"\n \"I'm drunk,\" Rebecca said.\n Too many of our citizens are drunk at times when they should be sober--suppertime, for example. Drunkenness leads to forgetting where you have put your watch, keys, or money clip, and to a decreased sensitivity to the needs and desires and calm good health of others. The causes of overuse of alcohol are not as clear as the results. Psychiatrists feel in general that alcoholism is a serious problem but treatable, in some cases. AA is said to be both popular and effective. At base, the question is one of willpower.\n \"Get up,\" Hilda said. \"I'm sorry I said that.\"\n \"You told the truth,\" said Rebecca.\n \"Yes, it was the truth,\" Hilda admitted.\n \"You didn't tell me the truth in the beginning. In the beginning, you said it was beautiful.\"\n \"I was telling you the truth, in the beginning. I did think it was beautiful. Then.\"\n This \"then,\" the ultimate word in Hilda's series of three brief sentences, is one of the most pain-inducing words in the human vocabulary, when used in this sense. Departed time! And the former conditions that went with it! How is human pain to be measured? But remember that Hilda, too... It is correct to feel for Rebecca in this situation, but, reader, neither can Hilda's position be considered an enviable one, for truth, as Bergson knew, is a hard apple, whether one is throwing it or catching it.\n \"What remains?\" Rebecca said stonily.\n \"I can love you in spite of--\"\n Do I want to be loved in spite of? Do you? Does anyone? But aren't we all, to some degree? Aren't there important parts of all of us which must be, so to say, gazed past? I turn a blind eye to that aspect of you, and you turn a blind eye to that aspect of me, and with these blind eyes eyeball-to-eyeball, to use an expression from the early 1960s, we continue our starched and fragrant lives. Of course it's also called \"making the best of things,\" which I have always considered a rather soggy idea for an Americal ideal. But my criticisms of this idea must be tested against those of others--the late President McKinley, for example, who maintained that maintaining a good, in not necessarily sunny, disposition was the one valuable and proper course.\n Hilda placed her hands on Rebecca's head.\n \"The snow is coming,\" she said. \"Soon it will be snow time. Together then as in other snow times. Drinking the busthead 'round the fire. Truth is a locked room that we knock the lock off from time to time, and then board up again. Tomorrow you will hurt me, and I will inform you that you have done so, and so on and so on. To hell with it. Come, viridian friend, come and sup with me.\" They sit down together. The pork with red cabbage steams before them. They speak quietly about the McKinley Administration, which is being revised by revisionist historians. The story ends. It was written or several reasons. Nine of them are secrets. The tenth is that one should never cease considering human love, which remains as grisly and golden as ever, no matter what it tattooed upon the warm tympanic page."

    "title": "Glass Mountain\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "1. I was trying to climb the glass mountain.\n\n 2. The glass mountain stands at the corner of Thirteenth Street and Eighth Avenue.\n\n 3. I had attained the lower slope.\n\n 4. People were looking up at me.\n\n 5. I was new in the neighborhood.\n\n 6. Nevertheless I had acquaintances.\n\n 7. I had strapped climbing irons to my feet and each hand grasped sturdy plumber's friend.\n\n 8. I was 200 feet up.\n\n 9. The wind was bitter.\n\n 10. My acquaintances had gathered at the bottom of the mountain to offer encouragement.\n\n 11. \"Shithead.\"\n\n 12. \"Asshole.\"\n\n 13. Everyone in the city knows about the glass mountain.\n\n 14. People who live here tell stories about it.\n\n 15. It is pointed out to visitors.\n\n 16. Touching the side of the mountain, one feels coolness.\n\n 17. Peering into the mountain, one sees sparkling blue-white depths.\n\n 18. The mountain towers over that part of Eighth Avenue like some splendid, immense office building.\n\n 19. The top of the mountain vanishes into the clouds, or on cloudless days, into the sun.\n\n 20. I unstuck the righthand plumber's friend leaving the lefthand one in place.\n\n 21. Then I stretched out and reattached the righthand one a little higher up, after which I inched my legs into new positions.\n\n 22. The gain was minimal, not an arm's length.\n\n 23. My acquaintances continued to comment.\n\n 24. \"Dumb motherfucker.\"\n\n 25. I was new in the neighborhood.\n\n 26. In the streets were many people with disturbed eyes.\n\n 27. Look for yourself.\n\n 28. In the streets were hundreds of young people shooting up in doorways, behind parked cars.\n\n 29. Older people walked dogs.\n\n 30. The sidewalks were full of dogshit in brilliant colors: ocher, umber, Mars yellow, sienna, viridian, ivory black, rose madder.\n\n 31. And someone had been apprehended cutting down trees, a row of elms broken-backed among the VWs and Valiants.\n\n 32. Done with a power saw, beyond a doubt.\n\n 33. I was new in the neighborhood yet I had accumulated acquaintances.\n\n 34. My acquaintances passed a brown bottle from hand to hand.\n\n 35. \"Better than a kick in the crotch.\"\n\n 36. \"Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.\"\n\n 37. \"Better than a slap in the belly with a wet fish.\"\n\n 38. \"Better than a thump on the back with a stone.\"\n\n 39. \"Won't he make a splash when he falls, now?\"\n\n 40. \"I hope to be here to see it. Dip my handkerchief in the blood.\"\n\n 41. \"Fart-faced fool.\"\n\n 42. I unstuck the lefthand plumber's friend leaving the righthand one in place.\n\n 43. And reached out.\n\n 44. To climb the glass mountain, one first requires a good reason.\n\n 45. No one has ever climbed the mountain on behalf of science, or in search of celebrity, or because the mountain was a challenge.\n\n 46. Those are not good reasons.\n\n 47. But good reasons exist.\n\n 48. At the top of the mountain there is a castle of pure gold, and in a room in the castle tower sits...\n\n 49. My acquaintances were shouting at me.\n\n 50. \"Ten bucks you bust your ass in the next four minutes!\"\n\n 51. ...a beautiful enchanted symbol.\n\n 52. I unstuck the righthand plumber's friend leaving the lefthand one in place.\n\n 53. And reached out.\n\n 54. It was cold there at 206 feet and when I looked down I was not encouraged.\n\n 55. A heap of corpses both of horses and riders ringed the bottom of the mountain, many dying men groaning there.\n\n 56. \"A weakening of the libidinous interest in reality has recently come to a close.\" (Anton Ehrenzweig)1\n\n 57. A few questions thronged into my mind.\n\n 58. Does one climb a glass mountain, at considerable personal discomfort, simply to disenchant a symbol?\n\n 59. Do today's stronger egos still need symbols?\n\n 60. I decided that the answer to these questions was \"yes.\"\n\n 61. Otherwise what was I doing there, 206 feet above the power-sawed elms, whose white meat I could see from my height?\n\n 62. The best way to fail to climb the mountain is to be a knight in full armor--one whose horse's hoofs strike fiery sparks from the sides of the mountain.\n\n 63. The following-named knights had failed to climb the mountain and were groaning in the heap: Sir Giles Guilford, Sir Henry Lovell, Sir Albert Denny, Sir Nicholas Vaux, Sir Patrick Grifford, Sir Gisbourne Gower, Sir Thomas Grey, Sir Peter Coleville, Sir John Blunt, Sir Richard Vernon, Sir Walter Willoughby, Sir Stephen Spear, Sir Roger Faulconbridge, Sir Clarence Vaughan, Sir Hubert Ratcliffe, Sir James Tyrrel, Sir Walter Herbert, Sir Robert Brakenbury, Sir Lionel Beaufort, and many others.2\n\n 64. My acquaintances moved among the fallen knights.\n\n 65. My acquaintances moved among the fallen knights, collecting rings, wallets, pocket watches, ladies' favors.\n\n 66. \"Calm reigns in the country, thanks to the confident wisdom of everyone.\" (M. Pompidou)3\n\n 67. The golden castle is guarded by a lean-headed eagle with blazing rubies for eyes.\n\n 68. I unstuck the lefthand plumber's friend, wondering if--\n\n 69. My acquaintances were prising out the gold teeth of not-yet dead knights.\n\n 70. In the streets were people concealing their calm behind a fa√ßade of vague dread.\n\n 71. \"The conventional symbol (such as the nightingale, often associated with melancholy), even though it is recognized only through agreement, is not a sign (like the traffic light) because, again, it presumably arouses deep feelings and is regarded as possessing properties beyond what the eye alone sees.\" (A Dictionary of Literary Terms)\n\n 72. A number of nightingales with traffic lights tied to their legs flew past me.\n\n 73. A knight in pale pink armor appeared above me.\n\n 74. He sank, his armor making tiny shrieking sounds against the glass.\n\n 75. He gave me a sideways glance as he passed me.\n\n 76. He uttered the word \"Muerte\"4 as he passed me.\n\n 77. I unstuck the righthand plumber's friend.\n\n 78. My acquaintances were debating the question, which of them would get my apartment?\n\n 79. I reviewed the conventional means of attaining the castle.\n\n 80. The conventional means of attaining the castle are as follows: \"The eagle dug its sharp claws into the tender flesh of the youth, but he bore the pain without a sound, and seized the bird's two feet with his hands. The creature in terror lifted him high up into the air and began to circle the castle. The youth held on bravely. He saw the glittering palace, which by the pale rays of the moon looked like a dim lamp; and he saw the windows and balconies of the castle tower. Drawing a small knife from his belt, he cut off both the eagle's feet. The bird rose up in the air with a yelp, and the youth dropped lightly onto a broad balcony. At the same moment a door opened, and he saw a courtyard filled with flowers and trees, and there, the beautiful enchanted princess.\" (The Yellow Fairy Book)5\n\n 81. I was afraid.\n\n 82. I had forgotten the Bandaids.\n\n 83. When the eagle dug its sharp claws into my tender flesh--\n\n 84. Should I go back for the Bandaids?\n\n 85. But if I went back for the Bandaids I would have to endure the contempt of my acquaintances.\n\n 86. I resolved to proceed without the Bandaids.\n\n 87. \"In some centuries, his [man's] imagination has made life an intense practice of all the lovelier energies.\" (John Masefield)6\n\n 88. The eagle dug its sharp claws into my tender flesh.\n\n 89. But I bore the pain without a sound, and seized the bird's two feet with my hands.\n\n 90. The plumber's friends remained in place, standing at right angles to the side of the mountain.\n\n 91. The creature in terror lifted me high in the air and began to circle the castle.\n\n 92. I held on bravely.\n\n 93. I saw the glittering palace, which by the pale rays of the moon looked like a dim lamp; and I saw the windows and balconies of the castle tower.\n\n 94. Drawing a small knife from my belt, I cut off both the eagle's feet.\n\n 95. The bird rose up in the air with a yelp, and I dropped lightly onto a broad balcony.\n\n 96. At the same moment a door opened, and I saw a courtyard filled with flowers and trees, and there, the beautiful enchanted symbol.\n\n 97. I approached the symbol, with its layers of meaning, but when I touched it, it changed into only a beautiful princess.\n\n 98. I threw the beautiful princess headfirst down the mountain to my acquaintances.\n\n 99. Who could be relied upon to deal with her.\n\n 100.

But now that Spicy MacLammermoor, the old king, is dead, I guess I'm it. Maybe I better play a few notes out of this window here, to reassure myself.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Wow!\" said somebody standing on the sidewalk. \"Did you hear that?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"I did,\" said his companion.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Can you distinguish our great homemade American jazz performers, each from the other?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Used to could.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Then who was that playing?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Sounds like Hokie Mokie to me.

He's the king of jazz, now that Spicy MacLammermoor is gone.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Hoke Mokie put his trombone in its trombone case and went to a gig. At the gig everyone fell back before him, bowing.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Hi Bucky! Hi Zoot! Hi Freddie! Hi George! Hi Thad! Hi Roy! Hi Dexter! Hi Jo! Hi Willie! Hi Greens!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"What we gonna play, Hokie? You the king of jazz now, you gotta decide.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"How 'bout 'Smoke'?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Wow!\" everybody said. \"Did you hear that? Hokie Mokie can just knock a fella out, just the way he pronounces a word. What a intonation on that boy! God Almighty!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"I don't want to play 'Smoke,'\" somebody said.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Would you repeat that, stranger?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"I don't want to play 'Smoke.' 'Smoke' is dull. I don't like the changes. I refuse to play 'Smoke.'\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"He refuses to play 'Smoke'!

OK, now we gonna play 'Smoke' just like Hokie said. You ready, Hokie? OK, give you four for nothin'. One! Two! Three! Four!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The two men who had been standing under Hokie's window had followed him into the club. Now they said:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Good God!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Yes, that's Hokie's famous 'English sunrise' way of playing. Playing with lots of rays coming out of it, some red rays, some blue rays, some green rays, some green stemming from a violet center, some olive stemming from a tan center-\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"That young Japanese fellow is pretty good, too.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Yes, he is pretty good. And he holds his horn in a peculiar way. That's frequently the mark of a superior player.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Bent over like that with his head between his knees - good God, he's sensational!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He's sensational, Hokie thought. Maybe I ought to kill him.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†But at that moment somebody came in the door pushing in front of him a four-and-one-half-octave marimba. Yes, it was Fat Man Jones, and he began to play even before he was fully in the door.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"What're we playing?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"'Billie's Bounce.'\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"That's what I thought it was.

You don't fool around with the king of jazz. That young Japanese guy's pretty good, too.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"He's sensational.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"You think he's playing in Japanese?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Well I don't think it's English.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This trombone's been makin' my neck green for thirty-five years, Hokie thought.

You're just about as good as me, I regret to say. In fact, I've decided you're *better* than me. It's a hideous thing to contemplate, but there it is. I have only been the king of jazz for twenty-four hours, but the unforgiving logic of this art demands we bow to Truth, when we hear it.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Maybe you're mistaken?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"No, I got ears. I'm not mistaken. Hideo Yamaguchi is the new king of jazz.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"You want to be king emeritus?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"No, I'm just going to fold up my horn and steal away. This gig is yours, Hideo. You can pick the next tune.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"How 'bout 'Cream'?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"OK, you heard what Hideo said, it's 'Cream.' You ready, Hideo?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Hokie, you don't have to leave. You can play too. Just move a little over to the side there - \"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Thank you, Hideo, that's very gracious of you. I guess I will play a little, since I'm still here. Sotto voce, of course.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Hideo is wonderful on 'Cream'!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Yes, I imagine it's his best tune.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"What's that sound coming in from the side there?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Which side?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"The left.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"You mean that sound that sounds like the cutting edge of life? That sounds like polar bears crossing Arctic ice pans? That sounds like a herd of musk ox in full flight? That sounds like male walruses diving to the bottom of the sea? That sounds like fumaroles smoking on the slopes of Mt. Katmai? That sounds like the wild turkey walking through the deep, soft forest? That sounds like beavers chewing trees in an Appalachian marsh? That sounds like an oyster fungus growing on an aspen trunk? That sounds like a mule deer wandering a montane of the Sierra Nevada? That sounds like prairie dogs kissing? That sounds like witchgrass tumbling or a river meandering? That sounds like manatees munching seaweed at Cape Sable? That sounds like coatimundis moving in packs across the face of Arkansas? That sounds like - \"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Good God, it's Hokie! Even with a cup mute on, he's blowing Hideo right off the stand!\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Hideo's on his knees now!

    "title": "Languishing, half-deep in summer...\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†Languishing, half-deep in summer, soul-sick and under-friended, I decided to find love. So I zipped over to the new-suit store and bought me a Giorgio Armani rig, unbacked, and a little skinny nothing tie to go with it, and some face bronzer by Daunt. Thinking: O mistress mine, where are you hiding? Are you at the Whitney Museum, cheek to cheek with the George Segal retrospective? Are you at Crazy Eddie's, bent over the Grover Washington, Jr. bin? Are you at Paragon Sporting Goods, in the killer-knife area? Have you got your thumb stuck in a dark green avocado at Balducci's fruit and produce? Are you riding a Japanese ten-speed the wrong way down Sixth Avenue, with friends? With a whistle in your mouth? Whistling, whistling, wildly whistling?\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†So I answered an ad in the back pages of a literary review - Box 222, to be precise - and got me a pretty, lively, succesful, vibrant prof. female, fluent French, German, witty affectionate caring, backgammon, racquetball. She was vibrating visibly when we met, at One Fifth in the bar, but I cooled her out with about half a gallon of kir; she was indeed pretty, lively, witty, and her name was Mindy Sue.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She asked if it had been raining in my part of the city, and I said no, the suit was supposed to look that way, it was an unbacked Giorgio Armani. We looked at my credit cards for a while and then she showed me hers, shyly - her American Express, her Avis, her Bergdorf's. We discussed backgammon, racquetball, three hundred films, and the urban crisis. Then I said, \"Mindy Sue, you are a pretty, lively, successful female, fluent in French and German. You are a professional woman but also sportif. You care buckets, I can see that. How did you get yourself in this terrible predicament? How did you become a four-line seventy-five-cents-a-word advertisement in the back pages of The New York Review of Books?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Pete,\" she said, \"there are thousands of us. The true urban crisis, from my angle of vision, is marriage. All the good men are married, and most of the bad. There is nothing much left except lames, kiddies, and poor people. What can I do? You think I like describing myself as 'cultivated, sensuous'?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I said that hadn't been in the ad.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Whoops,\" she said. \"Must have been the Saturday Review. Or maybe the Chronicle of Higher Education. Sometimes I have trouble keeping track.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I said she seemed to have a lot of lines out.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Well some of these dealies pull and some don't,\" she answered, splashing a little kir behind her ears. \"One is looking for a certain type of person, right? One stuffs one's message into the bottle and hopes for the best. You should see what springs from semiotexte. Or praxis 4. Let me tell you, if a journal runs its logo in lower case, what you get is lower depths. With mauve teeth, usually.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Ghastly, I said.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Mindy Sue looked a bit fierce - matter of lowering the lovely eyebrows. \"I have also,\" she said, \"responded to some of these items. Myself. 'Dynamic, attractive professor seeks supplemental relationship with superior fox, to 40.' It was piggy of me. Like that cutoff point? Like it? Like that 'supplemental'? Well, I was punished. He took me to a joint so tacky that when I ordered Cherries Jubilee the captain said 'We don't flame for one.' Can you hear that? 'We don't flame for one'?\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I said something to the effect that the course of periodical love was seldom smooth, and that some comfort could be derived from the excellent editorial matter - the parsley, as it were, in these particular meat marts.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"Well, I bring it on my own damn self,\" said Mindy Sue. \"I could sit home and talk to myself in my fluent French and German, I suppose. I could be witty, affectionate, caring with the cat. I could go to the George Segal retrospective at the Whitney and think about the human condition, or plaster. I have a ten-speed Japanese bicycle and a whistle. Nobody's forcing me to insert myself in the back pages of the damn New York Review of Books-\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She seemed distraught; I beamed support at her through my newly bronzed fa√ßade.\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\"But I will not give up!\" she said, pounding on the table with her small fist and making the dead Salems dance in their ashtray. \"I will persevere. I will check out handsome, cerebral, overachieving prof. male, young 42, likes music, ballet, stamps & coins. I will investigate earthy, outgoing, tall semiretired humanist idealist, 28, sincerer, intelligent. I will invest an evening in warm, bright, NY mensch, assertive but not hostile booklover, walks, talks, concerts. I have to try.\"\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I bought her a wurst and an anisette, and told her she was brave."

    "title": "The Party\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\nI went to a party and corrected a pronunciation. The man whose voice I had adjusted fell back into the kitchen. I praised a Bonnard. It was not a Bonnard. My new glasses, I explained, and I'm terribly sorry, but significant variations elude me, vodka exhausts me, I was young once, essential services are being maintained. Drums, drums, drums, outside the windows. I thought that if I could persuade you to say \"No,\" then my own responsibility would be limited, or changed, another sort of life would be possible, different from the life we had previously, somewhat skeptically, enjoyed together. But you had wandered off into another room, testing the effect on members of the audience of your ruffled blouse, your long magenta skirt. Giant hands, black, thick with fur, reaching in through the window. Yes, it was King Kong, back in action, and all of the guests uttered loud exclamations of fatigue and disgust, examining the situation in the light of their own needs and emotions, hoping that the ape was real or papier-mache according to their temperments, or wondering whether other excitements were possible out in the crisp, white night.\n\n\"Did you see him?\"\n\n\"Let us pray.\"\n\nThe important tasks of a society are often entrusted to people who have fatal flaws. Of course we tried hard, it was intelligent to do so, extraordinary efforts were routine. Your zest was, and is, remarkable. But carrying over into private life attitudes that have been successful in the field of public administration is not, perhaps, a good idea. Zest is not fun for everybody. I am aware that roles change. Kong himself is now an adjunct professor of art history at Rutgers, co-author of a text on tomb scupture; if he chooses to come to a party through the window he is simply trying to make himself interesting. A lady spoke to me, she had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas. \"I have attempted to be agreeable,\" she said, \"but it's like teaching iron to swim, with this group.\" Zest is not fun for everybody. When whippoorwills called, you answered. And then I would go out, with the lantern, up and down the streets, knocking on doors, asking perfect strangers if they had seen you. OK. That is certainly one way of doing it. This is not a complaint. But wouldn't it be better to openly acknowledge your utter reliance on work, on specific, carefully formulated directions, agreeing that, yes, a certain amount of anesthesia is derived from what other people would probably think of as some kind of career? Excel if you want, but remember that there are gaps. You told me that you had thought, as a young girl, that masturbation was \"only for men.\" Couldn't you be mistaken about other things, too?\n\nThe two sisters were looking at the television in the bedroom, on the bed, amidst the coats and hats, umbrellas, airline bags. I gave them each a drink and we watched the game together, the Osservatore Romano team vs. the Diet of Worms, Worms leading by six points. I had never seen khaki-colored punch before. The hostess said there would be word games afterward, some of the people outside would be invited in, peasant food would be served in big wooden bowls -- wine, chicken, olive oil, bread. Everything would improve, she said. I could still hear, outside, the drums; whistles had been added, and there were both whistles and drums. I was surprised. The present era, with its emphasis on emotional cost control as well as its insistent, almost annoying lucidity, does not favor splinter groups, because they can't win. Small collective manifestations are OK insofar as they show \"stretch marks\" -- traces of strain which tend to establish that public policy is not a smooth, seamless achievement, like an egg, but has rather been hacked out at some cost to the policymakers. Kong got to his feet. \"Louise loves me,\" he said, pointing to a girl, \"but I would rather sleep with Cynthia Garmonsway. It's just one of those things. Human experience is different, in some ways, from ape experience, but that doesn't mean I don't like perfumed nights, too.\" I know what he means. The mind carries you with it, away from what you are supposed to do, toward things that cannot be explained rationally, toward difficulty, lack of clarity, late-afternoon light.\n\n\"Francesca. Do you want to go?\"\n\n\"I want to stay.\"\n\nNow the sisters have begun taking their interminable showers, both bathrooms are tied up, I must either pretend not to know them or accept the blame. In the larger rooms tender fawns and pinks have replaced the earlier drab, sad colors. I noticed that howls and rattles had been added to the whistles and drums. Is it some kind of revolution? Maybe a revolution in taste, as when Mannerism was overthrown by the Baroque. Kong is being curried by Cynthia Garmonsway. She holds the steel curry comb in her right hand and pulls it gently through the dark thick fur. Cynthia formerly believed in the \"enormous diversity of things\"; now she believes in Kong. The man whose pronunciation I had corrected emerged from the kitchen. \"Probably it is music,\" he said, nodding at the windows, \"the new music, which we older men are too old to understand.\n\nYou, of course, would never say such a thing to me, but you have said worse things. You told me that Kafka was not a thinker, and that a \"genetic\" approach to his work would disclose that much of it was only a kind of very imaginative whining. That was during the period when you were going in for wrecking operations, feeling, I suppose, that the integrity of your own mental processes was best maintained by a series of strong, unforgiving attacks. You made quite an impression on everyone, in those days: you ruffled blouse, you long magenta skirt slit to the knee, the dagger thrust into your boot. \"Is that a metaphor?\" I asked, pointing to the dagger; you shook your head, smiled, said no. Now that you have had a change of heart, now that you have joined us in finding Kafka and Kleist, too, the awesome figures that we have agreed that they are, the older faculty are more comfortable with you, are ready to promote you, marry you, even if that is your wish. But you don't have to make up your mind tonight.\n\nRelax and enjoy the party, to the extent that it is possible to do so; it is not over yet. THe game has ended, a news program has begun. \"Emerald mines in the northwest have been nationalized.\" A number of young people standing in a meadow, holding hands, singing. Can the life of the time be caught in an advertisement? Is that how it is, really, in the meadows of the world?\n\nAnd where are all the new people I have come here to meet? I have met only a lost child, dressed in rags, real rags, holding an iron hook attached to a fifty-foot rope. I said, \"What is that for?\" The child said nothing, placed the hook quietly on the floor at my feet, opened a bottle and swallowed twenty aspirin. Is six too young for a suicide attempt? We fed her milk, induced vomiting, the police arrived within minutes. When one has spoken a lot one has already used up all of the ideas one has. You must change the people you are speaking to so that you appear, to yourself, to be still alive. But the people here don't look new; they look like emerald-mine owners, or proprietors of some other sector of the economy that something bad has just happened to. I'm afraid that going up to them and saying \"Travel light!\", with a smile, will not really lift their spirits. Why am I called upon to make them happier, when it is so obviously beyond my competence? Francesca, you have selected the wrong partner, in me. You made a mistake a long time ago. I am not even sure that I like you now. But it is true that I cannot stop thinking about you, that every small daily problem -- I will never be elected to the academy, Richelieu is against me and d'Alembert is lukewarm -- is examined in the light of your possible reaction, or displeasure. At one moment you say the Academy is a joke, at another you are working industriously to sway Webster to my cause. Damned capricious! In the silence, an alphorn sounds. THen the noise again, drums, whistles, howls, rattles, alphorns. Attendants place heavy purple veils or shroudes over statuary, chairs, the buffet table, members of the orchestra. People are clustered in front of the bathroom holding the fine deep-piled towels, vying to dry the beautiful sisters. The towels move sensuously over the beautiful surfaces. I too could be excited by this tissue.\n\nDear Francesca, tell me, is this a successful party, in your view? Is this the best we can do? I know that you have always wanted to meet Kong; now that you have met him and he has said whatever he has said to you (I saw you smiling), can we go home? I mean you to your home, me to my home, all these others to their own homes, cells, cages? I am feeling a little ragged. What made us think that we could escape things like bankruptcy, alcoholism, being disappointed, haing children. Say \"No,\" refuse me once and for all, let me try something else. Of course we did everything right, insofar as we were able to imagine what \"right\" was. Is is really important to know that this movie is fine, and that one terrible, and to talk intelligently about the difference? Wonderful elegance! No good at all!"

Little green flies fillthe air. CortÔøΩs and Montezuma are holding hands; from time to time one of them disengages a hand to brush away a fly.\n\nMontezuma receives new messages, in picture writing, from the hills. These he burns, so that CortÔøΩs will not learn their contents. CortÔøΩs is trimming his black beard.\n\nDoÔøΩa Marina, the Indian translator, is sleeping with CortÔøΩs in the palace given him by Montezuma. CortÔøΩs awakens; they share a cup of chocolate. She looks tierd, CortÔøΩs thinks.\n\nDown by the docks, CortÔøΩs and Montezuma walk, holding hands. \"Are you acquainted with a Father Sanchez?\" Montezuma asks. \"Sanchez, yes, what's he been up to?\" says CortÔøΩs. \"Overturning idols,\" says Montezuma. \"Yes,\" CortÔøΩs says vaguely, \"yes, he does that, everywhere we go.\"\n\nAt a concert sater that evening, CortÔøΩs is bitten on the ankle by a green insect. The bug crawls into his velvet slipper. CortÔøΩs removes the slipper, feels around inside, finds the bug and removes it. \"Is this poisonous?\" he asks DoÔøΩa Marina. \"Perfectly,\" she says.\n\nMontezuma himself performs the operation upon CortÔøΩs's swollen ankle. He lances the bitten place with a sharp knife, then sucks the poison from the wound, spits. Soon they are walking again, down by the docks.\n\nMontezuma writes, in a letter to his mother: \"The new forwardness of the nobility has come as a welcome relief. Whereas formerly members of the nobility took pains to hide among the general population, to pretend that they were ordinary people, they are now flaunting themselves and their position in the most disgusting ways. Once again they wear scarlet sashes from shoulder to hip, even on the boulevards; once again they prance about in their great powdered wigs; once again they employ lackeys to stand in pairs on little shelves at the rear of their limousines. The din raised by their incessant visiting of one another is with us from noon until early in the morningÔøΩ\n\n\"This flagrant behavior is, as I say, welcome. For we are all tired of having to deal with their manifold deceptions, of uncovering their places of concealment, of keeping track of their movements-in short, of having to think about them, of having to remember them. Their new assertiveness, however much it reminds us of the excesses of former times, is easier. The interesting question is, what has emboldened the nobility to emerge from obscurity at this time? Why now?\n\n\"Many people here are of the opinion that it is a direct consequence of the plague of devils we have had recently. It is easily seen that against a horizon of devils, the reappearance of the nobility can only be considered a more or less tolerable circumstance-they themselves must have realized this. Not since the late years of the last Bundle have we had so many spitting, farting, hair-shedding devils abroad. Along with the devils there have been roaches, roaches big as ironing boards. Then, too, we have the SpaniardsÔøΩ\"\n\nA group of great lords hostile to Montezuma holds a secret meeting in Vera Cruz, under the special protection of the god Smoking Mirror. Debate is fierce; a heavy rain is falling; new arrivals crowd the room.\n\nDoÔøΩa Marina, although she is the mistress of CortÔøΩs, has an Indian lover of high rank as well. Making her confession to Father Sanchez, she touches upon this. \"His name is Cuitlahuac? This may be useful politically. I cannot give you absolution, but I will remember you in my prayers.\"\n\nIn the gardens of TenochtitlÔøΩn, whisperers exchange strange new words: guillotine, white pepper, sincerity, temperament.\n\nCortÔøΩs's men break through many more walls but behind these walls they find, invariably, only the mummified carcasses of dogs, cats, and sacred birds.\n\nDown by the docks, CortÔøΩs and Montezuma walk, holding hands. CortÔøΩs has employed a detective to follow Montezuma; Montezuma has employed a detective to follow Father Sanchez. \"There are only five detectives of talent in TenochtitlÔøΩn,\" says Montezuma. \"There are others, but I don't use them. Visions are best-better than the best detective.\"\n\nAtop the great Cue, or pyramid, CortÔøΩs strikes an effigy of the god Blue Hummingbird and knocks off its golden mask; an image of the Virgin is installed in its place.\n\n\"The heads of the Spaniards,\" says DoÔøΩa Marina , \"Juan de Escalante and the five others, were arranged in a row on a pike. The heads of their horses were arranged in another row on another pike, set beneath the first.\"\n\nCortÔøΩs screams.\n\nThe guards run in, first CristÔøΩbal de Olid, and following him Pedro de Alvarado and then OrdÔøΩs and de Tapia.\n\nCortÔøΩs is raving. He runs from the palace into the plaza where he meets and is greeted by Montezuma. Two great lords stand on either side of Montezuma supporting his arms, which are spread wide greeting. They fold Montezuma's arms around CortÔøΩs. CortÔøΩs speaks urgently into Montezuma's ear.\n\nMontezuma removes from his bosom a long cactus thorn and pricks his ear with it repeatedly, until the blood flows.\n\nDoÔøΩa Marina is walking, down by the docks, with her lover Cuitlahuac, Lord of the Place of the Dunged Water. \"When I was young,\" says Cuitlahuac, \"I was at school with Montezuma. He was, in contrast to the rest of us, remarkably chaste. A very religious man, a great student-I'll wager that's what they talk about, Montezuma and CortÔøΩs. Theology.\" DoÔøΩa Marina tucks a hand inside his belt, at the back.\n\nBernal Diaz del Castillo, who sill one day write The True History of the Conquest of New Spain, stands in a square whittling upon a piece of mesquite. The Proclamation of Vera Cruz is read, in which the friendship of CortÔøΩs and Montezuma is denounced as contrary to the best interests of the people of Mexico, born and yet unborn.\n\nCortÔøΩs and Montezuma are walking, down by the docks. \"I especially like the Holy Ghost. Qua idea,\" says Montezuma. \"The other God, the Father, is also-\" \"One God, three Persons,\" CortÔøΩs corrects gently. \"That the Son should be sacrificed,\" Montezuma continues, \"seems to me wrong. In seems to me He should be sacreficed to. Furthermore,\" Montezuma stops and taps CortÔøΩs meaningfully on the chest with a brown forefinger, \"where is the Mother?\"\n\nBernal asks Montezuma, as a great favor, for a young pretty woman; Montezuma sends him a young woman of good family, together with a featherwork mantle, some crichets in cages, and a quantity of freshly made soap. Montezuma observes, of Bernal, that \"he seems to be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"The ruler prepares dramas for the people,\" Montezuma says.\n\nCortÔøΩs, sitting in an armchair, nods.\n\n\"Because the cultivation of maize requires on the average only fifty day's labor per person per year, the people's energies may be invested in these dramas-for example the eternal struggle to win, to retain, the good will of Smoking Mirror, Blue Hummingbird, QuetzalcoatlÔøΩ\"\n\nCortÔøΩs smiles and bows.\n\n\"Easing the psychological strain on the ruler who would otherwise be forced to face alone the prospect of world collapse, the prospect of the world folding in on itselfÔøΩ\"\n\nCortÔøΩs blinks.\n\n\"If the drama is not of my authorship, if events are not controllable by me-\"\n\nCortÔøΩs has no reply.\n\n\"Therefore it is incumbent upon you, dear brother, to disclose to me the ending or at least what you know of the drama's probable course so that I may attempt to manipulate it in a favorable direction with the application of what magic is left to me.\"\n\nCortÔøΩs has no reply.\n\nBreaking through a new wall, CortÔøΩs's men discover, on the floor of a chamber behind the wall, a tiny puddle of gold. The Proclamation is circulated throughout the city, is sent to other cities.\n\nBernal builds a stout hen coop for DoÔøΩa Marina. The sky over TenochtitlÔøΩn darkens; flashes of lighting; then rain sweeping off the lake.\n\nDown by the docks, CortÔøΩs and Montezuma take shelter in a doorway. \"DoÔøΩa Marina translated it; I have a copy,\" says CortÔøΩs.\n\n\"When you smashed Blue Hummingbird with the crowbar-\"\n\n\"I was rash. I admit it.\"\n\n\"You may take the gold with you. All of it. My gift.\"\n\n\"Your Highness is most kind.\"\n\n\"Your ships are ready. My messengers say their sails are as many as the clouds over the water.\"\n\n\"I cannot leave until all of the gold in Mexico, past, present and future, is stacked in the holds.\"\n\n\"Impossible on the face of it.\"\n\n\"I agree. Let us talk of something else.\"\n\nMontezuma notices that a certain amount of white lint has accumulated on his friend's black velvet doublet. He thinks: She should take better care of him.\n\nIn bed with CortÔøΩs, DoÔøΩa Marina displays for his eyes her beautiful golden buttocks, which he strokes reverently. A tiny green fly is buzzing about the room; CortÔøΩs brushes it away with a fly whisk made of golden wire. She tells him about a vision. In the vision Montezuma is struck in the forehead by a large stone, and falls. His enraged subjects hurl more stones.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" says CortÔøΩs. \"Trust me.\"\n\nFather Sanchez confronts CortÔøΩs with the report of the detective he has hired to follow DoÔøΩa Marina, together with other reports, documents, photographs. CortÔøΩs orders that all of the detectives in the city be arrested, that the profession of detective be abolished forever in TenochtitlÔøΩn, and that Father Sanchez be sent back to Cuba in chains.\n\nIn the marketplaces and theatres of the city, new words are passed about: tranquillity, vinegar, entitlement, schnell.\n\nOn another day Montezuma and CortÔøΩs and DoÔøΩa Marina and the guard of CortÔøΩs and certain great lords of TenochtitlÔøΩn leave their places and are carried in palanquins to the part of the city called Cotaxtla.\n\nThere, they halt before a great house and dismount.\n\n\"What is this place?\" CortÔøΩs asks, for he has never seen it before.\n\nMontezuma replies that it is the meeting place of the Aztec council or legislature which formulates the laws for the people.\n\nCortÔøΩs expresses surprise and states that it had been his understanding that Montezuma is an absolute ruler answerable to no one-a statement DoÔøΩa Marina tactfully neglects to translate lest Montezuma be given offense by it.\n\nCortÔøΩs, with his guard at his back and Montezuma at his right hand, enters the building.\n\nAt the end of a long hallway he sees a group of functionaries each of whom wears in his ears long white goose quills filled with powdered gold. Here CortÔøΩs and his men are fumigated with incense from large pottery braziers, but Montezuma is not, the major-domos fix their eyes on the ground and do not look at him but greet him with great reverence saying, \"Lord, my Lord, my Great Lord.\"\n\nThe party is ushered through a pair of tall doors of fragrant cedar into a vast chamber hung with red and yellow banners. There, on low wooden benches divided by a broad aisle, sit the members of the council, facing a dais. There are perhaps three hundred of them, each wearing affixed to his buttocks a pair of mirrors as is appropriate to his rank. On the dais are three figures of considerable majesty, the one in the center raised somewhat above his fellows; behind them, on the wall, hangs a great wheel of gold with much intricate featherwork depicting a whirlpool with the features of the goddess Chalchihuitlicue in the center. The council members sit in attitudes of rigid attention, arms held at their sides, chins lifted, eyes fixed on the dais. CortÔøΩs lays a hand on the shoulder of one of them, then recoils. He raps with his knuckles on that shoulder which gives forth a hollow sound. \"They are pottery,\" he says to Montezuma. Montezuma winks. CortÔøΩs begin to laugh. Montezuma begins to laugh. CortÔøΩs is choking, hysterical. CortÔøΩs and Montezuma run around the great hall, dodging in and out of the rows of benches, jumping into the laps of one or another of the clay figures, overturning some, turning others backward in their seats. \"I am the State!\" shouts Montezuma, and CortÔøΩs shouts, \"Mother of God, forgive this poor fool who doesn't know what he is saying!\"\n\nIn the kindest possible way, CortÔøΩs places Montezuma under house arrest.\n\n\"Best you come to stay with me a while.\"\n\n\"Thank you but I'd rather not.\"\n\n\"We'll have games and in the evenings, home movies.\"\n\n\"The people wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"We've got Pitalpitoque shackled to the great chain.\"\n\n\"I thought it was Quintalbor.\"\n\n\"Pitalpitoque, Quintalbor, Tendile.\"\n\n\"I'll send them chocolate.\"\n\n\"Come away, come away, come away with me.\"\n\n\"The people will be frightened.\"\n\n\"What do the omens say?\"\n\n\"I don't know I can't read them anymore.\"\n\n\"Cutting people's hearts out, forty, fifty, sixty at a crack.\"\n\n\"It's the custom around here.\"\n\n\"The people of the South say you take too much tribute.\"\n\n\"Can't run an empire without tribute.\"\n\n\"Our Lord Jesus Christ loves you.\"\n\n\"I'll send Him chocolate.\"\n\n\"Come away, come away , come away with me.\"\n\nDown by the docks, CortÔøΩs and Montezuma are walking with Charles V, Emperor of Spain. DoÔøΩa Marina follows at a respectful distance carrying two picnic baskets containing many delicacies: caviar, white wine, stuffed thrushes, gumbo.\n\nCharles V bends to hear what Montezuma is saying; CortÔøΩs brushes from the person of the Emperor little green flies, using a fly whisk made of golden wire. \"Was there no alternative?\" Charles asks. \"I did what I thought best,\" says CortÔøΩs, \"proceeding with gaiety and conscience.\" \"I am murdered,\" says Montezuma.\n\nThe sky over TenochtitlÔøΩn darkens; flashes of lighting; then rain sweeping off the lake.\n\nThe pair walking down by the docks, hand in hand, the ghost of Montezuma rebukes the ghost of CortÔøΩs. \"Why did you not throw up you hand, and catch the stone?\""

    "alltxt": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Have All\nMisunderstood\nBilly the Kid\n\nI was speaking to Amelia.\n\"Not self-slaughter in the crude sense. Rather the construction of surrogates. Think of it as a transplant.\"\n\"Daumier,\" she said, \"you are not making me happy.\"\n\"The false selves in their clatter and boister and youthful brio will slay and bother and push out and put to all types of trouble the original, authentic self, which is a dirty great villain, as can be testified and sworn to by anyone who has ever been awake.\"\n\"The self also dances,\" she said, \"sometimes.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I have noticed that, but one pays dear for the occasional schottische. Now, here is the point about the self: It is insatiable. It is always, always hankering. It is what you might call rapacious to a fault. The great flaming mouth to the thing is never in this world going to be stuffed full. I need only adduce the names of Alexander, Bonaparte, Messalina, and Billy the Kid.\"\n\"You have misunderstood Billy the Kid,\" she murmured.\n\"Whereas the surrogate, the construct, is in principle satiable. We design for satiability.\"\n\"Have you taken action?\" she asked. \"Or is all this just the usual?\"\n\"I have one out now,\" I said, \"a Daumier, on the plains and pampas of consciousness, and he is doing very well, I can tell you that He has an important post in a large organization. I get regular reports.\"\n\"What type of fellow is he?\"\n\"A good true fellow,\" I said, \"and he knows his limits. He doesn't overstep. Desire has been reduced in him to a minimum. Just enough left to make him go. Loved and respected by all.\"\n\"Tosh,\" she said, \"Tosh and bosh.\"\n\"You will want one,\" I said, \"when you see what they are like.\"\n\"We have all misunderstood Billy the Kid,\" she said in parting.\n\nA Long Sentence\nin Which the\nMiracle of Surrogation\nIs Performed\nBefore Your Eyes\n\nNow in his mind's eye which was open for business at all times even during the hours of sleep and dream and which was the blue of bedcovers and which twinkled and which was traced with blood a trifle at all times and which was covered at all times with a monocle of good quality, the same being attached by long thin black streamy ribands to his mind's neck, now in this useful eye Daumier saw a situation.\n\nMr. Bellows,\nMr. Hawkins,\nThe Traffic,\nChilidogs\n\nTwo men in horse-riding clothes upon a plain, their attitudes indicating close acquaintance or colleagueship. The plain presented in its foreground a heavy yellow oblong salt lick rendered sculptural by the attentions over a period of time of sheep or other salt-loving animals. Two horses in the situation's upper lefthand corner watched the men with nervous horse-gaze.\nMr. Bellows spoke to his horse.\n\"Stand still, horse.\"\nMr. Hawkins sat down atop the salt lick and filled a short brass pipe Oriental in character.\n\"Are they quiet now?\"\n\"Quiet as the grave,\" Mr. Bellows said. \"Although I don't know what we'll be doin' for quiet when the grass gives out.\"\n\"That'll be a while yet.\"\n\"And Daumier?\"\n\"Scoutin' the trail ahead,\" said Mr. Hawkins.\n\"He has his problems you must admit.\"\n\"Self-created in my opinion.\"\nMr. Hawkins took a deep draw upon his pipelet.\n\"The herd,\" he said.\n\"And the queen.\"\n\"And the necklace.\"\n\"And the cardinal.\"\n\"It's the old story,\" Mr. Hawkins stated. \"One word from the queen and he's off tearing about the countryside and let business go hang.\"\n\"There's such a thing as tending to business, all right,\" said Mr. Bellows. \"Some people never learned it.\"\n\"And him the third generation in the Traffic,\" Mr. Hawkins added. Then, after a moment: \"Lovely blue flowers there a while back. I don't suppose you noticed.\"\n\"I noticed,\" said Mr. Bellows. \"I picked a bunch.\"\n\"Did you, now. Where are they at?\"\n\"I give um to someone,\" Mr. Bellows said.\n\"Someone. What someone?\"\nThere was a silence.\n\"You are acquainted with the Rules, I believe,\" Mr. Hawkins said.\n\"Nothing in the Rules about bestowal of bluebonnets, I believe,\" Mr. Bellows replied.\n\"Bluebonnets, were they? Now, that's nice. That's very nice.\"\n\"Bluebonnets or indeed flowers of any kind are not mentioned in the Rules.\"\n\"We are promised to get this here shipment-\"\n\"I have not interfered with the shipment.\"\n\"We are promised to get this here herd of au-pair girls to the railhead intact in both mind and body,\" Mr. Hawkins stated. \"And I say that bestowal of bluebonnets is interferin' with a girl's mind and there's no two ways about it.\"\n\"She was looking very down-in-the-mouth.\"\n\"Not your affair. Not your affair.\"\nMr. Bellows moved to change the subject. \"Is Daumier likely to be back for chow do you think?\"\n\"What is for chow?\"\n\"Chilidogs.\"\n\"He'll be back. Daumier does love his chilidog.\"\n\nRÔøΩsumÔøΩ of the Plot\nor Argument\n\nIgnatius Loyola XVIII, with a band of hard-riding fanatical Jesuits under his command, has sworn to capture the herd and release the girls from the toils so-called Traffic, in which Daumier, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Bellows are prominent executives of long standing. Daumier meanwhile has been distracted from his proper business by a threat to the queen, the matter of the necklace (see Dumas, The Queen's Necklace, pp. 76-105).\n\n\nDescription of\nThree O'Clock\nin the Afternoon\n\nI left Amelia's place and entered the October afternoon. The afternoon was dying giving way to the dark night, yet some amount of sunglow still warmed the cunning-wrought cobbles of the street. Many citizens both male and female were hurrying hither and thither on errands of importance, each agitato step compromising slightly the sheen of the gray fine-troweled sidewalk. Immature citizens in several sizes were massed before a large factorylike structure where advanced techniques transformed them into true-thinking right-acting members of the three social classes, lower, middle, and upper middle. Some number of these were engaged in ludic agon with basketballs, the same being hurled against passing vehicles producing an unpredictable rebound. Dispersed amidst the hurly and burly of the children were their tenders, shouting. Inmixed with this broil were ordinary denizens of the quarter-shopmen, rentiers, churls, sellers of vicious drugs, stum-drinkers, aunties, girls whose jeans had been improved with appliquÔøΩ rose blossoms in the cleft of the buttocks, practicers of the priest hustle, and the like. Two officers of the Shore Patrol were hitting an imbecile Sea Scout with long shapely well-modeled nightsticks under the impression that they had jurisdiction. A man was swearing fine-sounding swearwords at a small yellow motorcar of Italian extraction, the same having joined its bumper to another bumper, the two bumpers intertangling like shameless lovers in the act of love. A man in the organic-vegetable hustle stood in the back of a truck praising tomatoes, the same being abulge with tomato-muscle and ablaze with minimum daily requirements. Several members of the madman profession made air sweet with their imprecating and their moans and the subtle music of the tearing their hair.\n\nThought\n\nAmelia is skeptical, I thought.\n\nList of Research\nMaterials Consulted\n\nMy plan for self-transplants was not formulated without the benefit of some amount of research. I turned over the literature, which is immense, the following volumes sticking in the mind as having been particularly valuable: The Self: An Introduction by Meyers, Self-Abuse by Samuels, The Armed Self by Carwlie, Burt's The Concept of Self, Self-Congratulation by McFee, Fingarette's Self-Deception, Self-Defense for Women and Young Girls by Birch, Winterman's Self-Doubt, The Effaced Self by Lilly, Self-Hatred in Vermin by Skinner, LeBett's Selfishness, Gordon's Self-Love, The Many-Colored Self by Winsor and Newton, Paramananda's Self-Mastery, The Misplaced Self by Richards, Nastiness by Bertini, The Self Prepares by Teller, Flaxman's The Self as Pretext, Hickel's Self-Propelled Vehicles, SÔøΩrensen's Self-Slaughter, Self and Society in Ming Through by DeBary, The Sordid Self by Clute, and Techniques of Self-Validation by Wright. These works underscored what I already knew, that the self is a dirty great villain, an interrupter of sleep, a deviler of awakeness, an intersubjective atrocity, a mouth, a maw. Transplantation of neutral or partially inert materials into the cavity was in my view the one correct solution.\n\nNeutral or Partially\nInert Materials\nCross a River\n\nA girl appeared holding a canteen.\n\"Is there any wine s'il vous plaÔøΩt?\"\n\"More demands,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"They accumulate.\"\n\"Some people do not know they are a member of a herd,\" said Mr. Bellows.\nThe girl turned to Daumier.\n\"Is it your intention to place all of us in this dirty water?\" she asked, pointing to the river. \"Together with our clothes and personal belongings as well?\"\n\"There is a ford,\" said Daumier. \"The water is only knee-high.\"\n\"And on the other bank, shooters? Oh, that's very fine. trÔøΩs intelligent.\"\n\"What's your name, Miss?\"\n\"Celeste,\" said the girl. \"Possibly there are vipers in the water? Poisonmouths?\"\n\"Possibly,\" said Daumier. \"But they won't hurt you. If you see one, just go around him.\"\n\"Myself, I will stay here, thank you. The other girls, they stay here too, I think.\"\n\"Celeste, you wouldn't be telling them about poisonmouths in the water, would you?\"\n\"It is not necessary. They can look for their own selves.\" She paused. \"Possibly you have a very intelligent plan for avoiding the shooters?\"\nShe is not pretty, Daumier thought. But a good figure.\n\"My papa is a lawyer,\" she said. \"An avocat.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"There was no word in the agreement about marching through great floods filled with vipers and catfishes.\"\n\"The problem is not the water but the Jesuits on the other side,\" said Daumier.\n\"The noble Loyola. Our resuscitator.\"\n\"You want to spend the next year in a convent? Wearing a long dress down to your feet and reading The Lives of the Saints and not a chilidog to your name?\"\n\"He will take us to the convent?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What a thing. I did not know.\"\n\"Daumier,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"What is your trÔøΩs intelligent plan?\"\n\"What if we send some of the girls in to bathe?\"\n\"What for?\"\n\"And while the enemy is struck blind by the dazzling beauty of our girls bathing, we cross the rest of them down yonder at the other ford.\"\n\"Ah, you mean bathing, uh-\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Could you get them to do it?\"\n\"I don't know.\" He turned to Celeste. \"What about it?\"\n\"There is nothing in the agreement about making Crazy Horse shows in the water. But on the other hand, the cloisterÔøΩ\"\n\"Yes,\" said Daumier.\nSoon seven girls wearing towels were approaching the water.\n\"You and Mr. Bellows cross the herd down there. I'll watch these for you,\" Daumier said to Mr. Hawkins.\n\"Oh, you will,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"That's nice. That's very nice indeed. That is what I call nice, that is.\"\n\"Mr. Hawkins,\" said Daumier.\nThen Daumier looked at Celeste and saw that the legs on her were as long and slim as his hope of Heaven and the thighs on her were as strong and sweet-shaped as ampersands and the buttocks on her were as pretty as two pictures and the waist on her was as neat and incurved as the waist of a fiddle and the shoulders on her were as tempting as sex crimes and the hair on her was as long and black as Lent and the movement of the whole was honey, and he sank into a swoon.\nWhen he awoke, he found Mr. Hawkins lifting him by his belt and lowering him to the ground again, repeatedly.\n\"A swoon most likely,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"He was always given to swoonin'.\"\nThe girls were gathered about him, fully dressed and combing their damp hair.\n\"He looks extremely charming when he is swooned,\" said Celeste. \"I don't like the eagle gaze so much.\"\n\"And his father and grandfather before him,\" said Mr. Hawkins, \"they were given to swoonin'. The grandfather particularly. Physical beauty it was that sent the grandfather to the deck. There are those who have seen him fall at the mere flash of a kneecap.\"\n\"Is the herd across?\" asked Daumier.\n\"Every last one of um,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"Mr. Bellows is probably handing out the TV dinners right now.\"\n\"We made a good exhibition, I think,\" said Celeste. \"Did you see?\"\n\"A little,\" said Daumier. \"Let's push across and join the others.\"\nThey crossed the river and climbed a ridge and went through some amount of brush and past a broke-down abandoned farmhouse with no roof and through a pea patch that nobody had tended for so many years that the peas in their pods were as big as Adam's apples. On the other side of the pea patch they found Mr. Bellows tied to a tree by means of a great many heavy ropes around his legs, stomach, and neck, and his mouth stuffed full of pages torn from a breviary. The herd was nowhere to be seen.\n\nTwo Whiskeys\nwith a Friend\n\n\"The trouble with you,\" said Gibbon, \"is that you are a failure.\"\n\"I am engaged upon a psychological thimblerig which may have sound commercial applications,\" I said. \"Vistas are opening.\"\n\"Faugh,\" he said.\n\"Faugh?\"\n\"The trouble with you is that you are an idiot,\" Gibbon said. \"You lack a sense of personal worthlessness. A sense of personal worthlessness is the motor that drives the overachiver to his splendid overachievements that we all honor and revere.\"\n\"I have it!\" I said. \"A deep and abiding sense of personal worthlessness. One of the best.\"\n\"It was your parents I expect,\" said Gibbon. \"They were possibly too kind. The family of orientation is charged above all with developing the sense of personal worthlessness. Some are sloppy about it. Some let this responsibility slide and the result is a child with no strong sense of personal worthlessness, thus no same being provable only by conspicuous and distinguished achievement above and beyond the call of reasonableness.\"\nI thought: His tosh is better than my tosh.\n\"I myself,\" said Gibbon, \"am slightly undertone in the personal worthlessness line. It was Papa's fault. He used no irony. The communications mix offered by the parent to the child is as you know twelve percent do this, eighty-two percent don't do that, and six percent huggles and endearments. That is standard. Now, to avoid boring himself or herself to death during this monition the parent enlivens the discourse with wit, usually irony of the cheaper sort. The irony ambigufies the message, but more importantly establishes in the child the sense of personal lack-of-worth. Because the child understands that one who is talked to in this way is not much of a something. Ten years of it goes a long way. Fifteen is better. That is where Pap fell down. He eschewed irony. Did you bring any money?\"\n\"Sufficient.\"\n\"Then I'll have another. What class of nonsense is this that you are up to with the surrogate?\"\n\"I have made up a someone who is taking the place of myself. I think about him rather than about me.\"\n\"The trouble with you is that you are simpleminded. No wonder you were sacked from your job in the think tank.\"\n\"I was thinking but I was thinking about wrong things.\"\n\"Does it work? This transplant business?\"\n\"I have not had a thought about myself in seven days.\"\n\"Personally,\" said Gibbon, \"I am of the opinion that the answer is Krishna Socialism.\"\n\nMr. Bellows\nIs Sprung;\nArrival of\na Figure;\nPopcorn Available\nin the Lower Lobby\n\n\"Our herd is rustled,\" said Mr. Hawkins.\nMr. Bellows was having pages of the Word removed from his mouth.\n\"Fifteen hundred head,\" said Daumier. \"My mother will never forgive me.\"\n\"How many men did he have with him?\" asked Mr. Hawkins.\n\"Well I only saw about four. Coulda been more. They jumped me just as we come outa the tree line. Two of 'em come at me from the left and two of 'em come at me from the right, and they damn near pulled me apart between 'em. And himself sittin' there on his great black horse with the five black hats on him and laughin' and gigglin' to beat all bloody hell. Then they yanked me off my horse and throwed me to the ground terrible hard and two of 'em sat on me while himself made a speech to the herd.\"\n\"What type of speech would that be?\"\n\"It began, 'Dearly beloved.' The gist of it was that Holy Mother the Church had arranged to rescue all the girls from the evil and vicious and low and reprehensible toils of the Traffic-meaning us-and the hardships and humiliations and degradations of au-pair life through the God-smiled-upon intervention of these hard-riding pure-of-heart Jesuits.\"\n\"How did the herd take it?\"\n\"Then he said confessions would be between two and four in the afternoon, and that evening services would be at eight sharp. Then there was a great lot of groanin'. That was from the herd. Then the girls commenced to ask the padres about the hamburger ration and the grass ration and which way was the john and all that, and the boys in black got a little bit flustered. They realized they had fifteen hundred head of ravenous au-pair girls on their hands.\"\n\"He seems a good thinker,\" said Celeste. \"To understand your maneuver beforehand, and to defeat it with his own very much superior maneuver-\"\nAt that moment a figure of some interest approached the group. The figure was wearing on the upper of his two lips a pair of black fine-curled mustachios and on the top of his head a hat with a feather or plume of a certain swash and on his shoulders a cape of dark-blue material of a certain swagger and on his trunk a handsome leather doublet with pot-metal clasps and on the bottom of him a pair of big blooming breeches of a peach velvet known to interior decorators for its appositeness in the upholstering of loveseats and around his waist a sling holding a long resplendent rapier and on his two hands great gauntlets of pink pigskin and on his fine-chiseled features an expression of high-class arrogance. The figure was in addition mounted upon the top of a tall-standing well-curried fast-trotting sheep.\n\"What it is?\" asked Mr. Bellows.\n\"Beats me,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"I think it is an actor.\"\n\"I know what it is,\" said Daumier. \"It is a musketeer.\"\n\nFurther Boiling\nof the Plot\nin Summary Form\n\nThe musketeer carries a letter from the queen which informs Daumier they Jeanne de Valois, a bad person attached to the court, has obtained the necklace, which is worth 1,600,000 francs, by persuading the Cardinal de Rohan, an admirer of the queen, to sign a personal note for the amount, he thinking he is making a present to the queen, she thinking that the necklace has been returned to the jewelers, Jeanne de Valois having popped the diamonds into an unknown hiding place. The king is very likely going to find out about the whole affair and become very angry, in several directions. Daumier is begged to come to the capital and straighten things out. He does so.\n\n\nHistory of the\nSociety of Jesus\n\nDriven from England, 1579\nDriven from France, 1594\nDriven from Venice, 1606\nDriven from Spain, 1767\nDriven from Naples, 1768\nSuppressed entirely by Clement XIV, 1773\nRevived, 1814\n\n\nSomething\nIs Happening\n\nI then noticed that I had become rather fond-fond to a fault-of a person in the life of my surrogate. It was of course the girl Celeste. My surrogate obviously found her attractive and no less did I; this was a worry. I began to wonder how I could get her out of his life and into my own.\n\n\nAmelia Objects\n\n\"What about me?\"\n\n\nQuotation from\nLa Fontaine\n\n\"I must have the new, though there be none left in the world.\"\n\n\nThe Parry\n\n\"You are insatiable,\" she said.\n\"I am in principle fifty percent sated,\" I said. \"Had I two surrogates I would be one hundred percent sated. Two are necessary so that no individual surrogate gets the big head. My identification with that Daumier who is even cleaning up all sorts of trouble in the queen's service is wonderful but there must be another. I see him as a quiet, thoughtful chap who leads a contemplative-type life. Maybe in the second person.\"\n\n\nThe New Surrogate\nGiven a Trial Run\n\nThis is not the worst time for doing what you are doing, and you are therefore pleased with yourself-not wildly, but a little. There are several pitfalls you have avoided. Other people have fallen into them. Standing at the rim of the pit, looking down at the sharpened stakes, you congratulate yourself on your good luck (because you know good sense cannot be credited) and move on. The conditions governing your life have been codified and set down in a little book, but no one has ever given you a copy, and when you have sought it in libraries, you are told that someone else has it on extended loan. Still, you are free to seek love, to the best of your ability, or to wash your clothes in the machines that stand with their round doors temptingly open, or to buy something in one of the many shops in this area-a puppy perhaps. Pausing before a show window full of puppies, brown and black and mixtures, you notice that they are very appealing. If only you could have one that would stay a puppy, and not grow into a full-sized dog. Your attachments are measured. Not that you are indifferent by nature-you want nothing so much as a deep-going, fundamental involvement-but this does not seem to happen. Your attachments are measured; each seems to last exactly two years. Why is that? On the last lap of a particular liaison, you feel that it is time to go, as if you were a guest at a dinner party and the host's offer of another brandy had a peculiar falseness to it. Full of good will, you attempt to pretend that you do not feel this way, you attempt to keep the level of cheerfulness and hope approximately where it has always been, to keep alive a sense of \"future.\" But no one is fooled. Optimistic plans are made, but within each plan is another plan, allowing for the possible absence of one of the planners. You eye the bed, the record-player, the pictures, already making lists of who will take what. What does this say about you-that you move from person to person, a tourist of the emotions? Is this meaning of failure? Perhaps it is too soon to decide. It has occurred to you that you, Daumier, may yet do something great. A real solid durable something, perhaps in the field of popular music, or light entertainment in general. These fields are not to be despised, although you are aware that many people look down on them. But perhaps a better-conceived attack might contain a shade less study. It is easy to be satisfied if you get out of things what inheres in them, but you must look closely, take nothing for granted, let nothing become routine. You must fight against the cocoon of habituation which covers everything, if you let it. There are always openings, if you can find them. There is always something to do.\n\n\nA Sampling of\nCritical Opinion\n\n\"He can maunder.\"\n\"Can't he maunder!\"\n\"I have not heard maundering of this quality since-\"\n\"He is maundering fool.\"\n\n\nCeleste Motors\nFrom One Sphere\nto Another Sphere\n\n\"She has run away,\" said Mr. Hawkins.\n\"Clean as a whistle,\" said Mr. Bellows.\n\"Herd-consciousness is hard thing to learn,\" said Mr. Hawkins. \"Some never learn it.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Bellows, \"there's the difficulty, the iddyological. You can get quite properly banjaxed there, with the iddyological.\"\n\n\nFood\n\nI was preparing a meal for Celeste-a meal of a certain elegance, as when arrivals or other rites of passage are to be celebrated.\nFirst off there were Saltines of the very best quality and of a special crispness, squareness, and flatness, obtained at great personal sacrifice by making representations to the National Biscuit Company through its authorized nuncios in my vicinity. Upon these was spread with a hand lavish and not sitting Todd's Liver PÔøΩtÔøΩ, the same having been robbed from geese and other famous animals and properly adulterated with cereals and other well-chosen extenders and the whole delicately spiced with calcium propionate to retard spoilage. Next there were rare cheese products from Wisconsin wrapped in gold foil in exquisite tints with interesting printings thereon, including some very artful representations of cows, the same being clearly in the best of health and good humor. Next there were dips of all kinds including clam, bacon with horseradish, onion soup with sour cream, and the like, which only my long acquaintance with some very high-up members of the Borden company allowed to grace my table. Next there were Fritos curved and golden to the number of 224 (approx.), or the full contents of the bursting 53c bag. Next there were Frozen Assorted Hors d'Oeuvres of a richness beyond description, these wrested away from an establishment catering only to the nobility, the higher clergy, and certain selected commoners generally agreed to be comers in their particular areas of commonality, calcium propionate added to retard spoilage. In addition there were Mixed Nuts assembled at great expense by the Planters concern from divers strange climes and hanging gardens, each nut delicately dusted with a salt that has no peer. Furthermore there were cough drops of the manufacture of the firm of Smith Fils, brown and savory and served in a bowl once the property of Brann the Iconoclast. Next there were young tender green olives into which ripe red pimentos had been cunningly thrust by underpaid Portuguese, real and true handwork every step of the way. In addition there were pearl onions meticulously separated from their nonstandard fellows by a machine that had caused the Board of Directors of the S&W concern endless sleepless nights and had passed its field trails just in time to contribute to the repast I am describing. Additionally there were gherkins whose just fame needs no further words from me. Following these appeared certain cream cheeses of Philadelphia origin wrapped in costly silver foil, the like of which a pasha could not have afforded in the dear dead days. Following were Mock Ortolans ManquÔøΩs made of the very best soybean aggregate, the like of which could not be found on the most sophisticated tables of Paris, London and Rome. The whole washed down with generous amounts of Tab, a fiery liquor brewed under license by the Coca-Cola Company which will not divulge the age-old secret recipe no matter how one begs and pleads with them but yearly allows a small quantity to circulate to certain connoisseurs and bibbers whose credentials meet the very rigid requirements of the Cellarmaster. All of this stupendous feed being a mere scherzo before the announcement of the main theme, chilidogs.\n\"What is all this?\" asked sweet Celeste, waving her hands in the air. \"Where is the food?\"\n\"You do not recognize a meal spiritually prepared,\" I said, hurt in the self-love.\n\"We will be very happy together,\" she said. \"I cook.\"\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI folded Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Bellows and wrapped them in tissue paper and put them carefully away in a drawer along with the king, the queen, and the cardinal. I was temporarily happy and content but knew that there would be a time when I would not be happy and content; at that time I could unwrap them and continue their pilgrimages. The two surrogates, the third-person Daumier and the second-person Daumier, were wrapped in tissue paper and placed in the drawer; the second-person Daumier especially will bear watching and someday when my soul is again sickly and full of sores I will take him out of the drawer and watch him. Now Celeste is making a daube and I will go into the kitchen and watch Celeste making the daube. She is placing strips of optional pork in the bottom of the pot. Amelia also places strips of optional pork in the bottom of a pot, when she makes a daube, but somehow- The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted. There are always openings, if you can find them, there is always something to do.\n\n"

    "title": "The Death of Edward Lear\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\nThe death of Edward Lear took place on a Sunday morning in May 1888. Invitations were sent out well in advance. The invitations read:\n\nMr. Edward LEAR\nNonsense Writer and Landscape Painter\n Requests the Honor of Your Presence\nOn the Occasion of his DEMISE.\nSan Remo 2:20 a.m.\nThe 29th of May Please reply\n\nOne can imagine the feelings of the recipients. Our dear friend! is preparing to depart! and such-like. Mr. Lear! who has given us so much pleasure! and such-like. On the other hand, his years were considered. Mr. Lear! who must be, now let me seeÔøΩ And there was a good deal of, I remember the first time I (dipped into) (was seized by)ÔøΩ But on the whole, Mr. Lear's acquaintances approached the occasion with a mixture of solemnity and practicalness, perhaps remembering the words of Lear's great friend, Tennyson:\n\nOld men must die,\nOr the world would grow mouldy\n\nand:\n\nFor men may come and men may go,\nBut I go on forever.\n\nPeople prepared to attend the death of Edward Lear as they might have for a day in the country. Picnic baskets were packed (for it would be wrong to expect too much of Mr. Lear's hospitality, under the circumstances); bottles of wine were wrapped in white napkins. Toys were chosen for the children. There were debates as to whether the dog ought to be taken or left behind. (Some of the dogs actually present at the death of Edward Lear could not restrain themselves; they frolicked about the dying man's chamber, tugged at the bedclothes, and made such nuisances of themselves that they had to be removed from the room.)\n\nMost of Mr. Lear's friends decided that the appropriate time to arrive at the Villa would be midnight, or in that neighborhood, in order to allow the old gentleman time to make whatever remarks he might have in mind, or do whatever he wanted to do, before the event. Everyone understood what the time specified in the invitation meant. And so, the visitors found themselves being handed down from their carriages (by Lear's servant Giuseppe Orsini) in almost total darkness. Pausing to greet people they knew, or to corral straying children, they were at length ushered into a large room on the first floor, where the artist had been accustomed to exhibit his watercolors, and thence by a comfortably wide staircase to a similar room on the second floor, where Mr. Lear himself waited, in bed, wearing an old velvet smoking jacket and his familiar silver spectacles with tiny oval lenses. Several dozen straight-backed chairs had been arranged in a rough semicircle around the bed; these were soon filled, and later arrivals stood along the walls.\n\nMr. Lear's first words were: \"I've no money!\" As each new group of guests entered the room, he repeated, \"I've no money! No money!\" He looked extremely tired, yet calm. His ample beard, gray yet retaining patches of black, had evidently not been trimmed in some days. He seemed nervous and immediately began to discourse, as if to prevent anyone else from doing so.\n\nHe began by thanking all those present for attending and expressing the hope that he had not put them to too great an inconvenience, acknowledging that the hour was \"an unusual one for visits!\" He said that he could not find words sufficient to disclose his pleasure in seeing so many of his friends gathered together at his side. He then delivered a pretty little lecture, of some twelve minutes' duration, on the production of his various writings, of which no one has been able to recall the substance, although everyone agreed that it was charming, graceful, and wise.\n\nHe then startled his guests with a question, uttered in a kind of shriek: \"Should I get married? Get married? Should I marry?\"\n\nMr. Lear next offered a short homily on the subject of Friendship. Friendship, he said, is the most golden if the affections. It is also, he said, often the strongest of human ties, surviving strains and tempests fatal to less sublime relations. He noted that his own many friendships constituted the richest memory of a long life.\n\nA disquisition on Cats followed.\n\nWhen Mr. Lear reached the topic Children, a certain restlessness was observed among his guests. (He had not ceased to shout at intervals. \"Should I get married?\" and \"I've no money!\") He then displayed copies of his books, but as everybody had already read them, not more than a polite interest was generated. Next he held up, one by one, a selection of his watercolors, views of various antiquities and picturesque spots. These, too, were familiar; they were the same watercolors the old gentleman had been offering for sale, at ÔøΩ5 and ÔøΩ10, for the past forty years.\n\nMr. Lear now sang a text of Tennyson's in a setting of his own, accompanying himself on a mandolin. Although his voice was thin and cracked frequently, the song excited vigorous applause.\n\nFinally he caused to be hauled into the room by servants an enormous oil, at least seven feet by ten, depicting Mount Athos. There was a murmur of appreciation, but it did not seem to satisfy the painter, for he assumed a very black look.\n\nAt 2:15 Mr. Lear performed a series of actions the meaning of which was obscure to the spectators.\n\nAt 2:20 he reached over to the bedside table, picked up an old-fashioned pen which lay there, and died. A death mask was immediately taken. The guests, weeping unaffectedly, moved in a long line back to the carriages.\n\nPeople who attended the death of Edward Lear agreed that, all in all, it had been a somewhat tedious performance. Why had he seen fit to read the same old verses, sing again the familiar songs, show the well-known pictures, run through his repertoire once more? Why invitations? Then something was understood: that Mr. Lear had been doing what he had always done and therefore, not doing anything extraordinary. Mr. Lear had transformed the extraordinary into its opposite. He had, in point of fact, created a gentle, genial misunderstanding.\n\nThus the guests began, as time passed, to regard the affair in an historical light. They told their friends about it, reenacted parts of it for their children and grandchildren. They would reproduce the way the old man had piped \"I've no money!\" in a comical voice, and quote his odd remarks about marrying. The death of Edward Lear became so popular, as the time passed, that revivals were staged in every part of the country, with considerable success. The death of Edward Lear can still be seen, in the smaller cities, in versions enriched by learned interpretation, textual emendation, and changing fashion. One modification is curious; no one knows how it came about. The supporting company plays in the traditional way, but Lear himself appears shouting, shaking, vibrant with rage."

    "alltxt": "\n\nARMY PLANS TO FREEZE\n 3 MILLION BIRDS TO DEATH\n\nMILAN, Tenn., Feb. 14 (AP)--The Army is planning to freeze to death three million or so blackbirds that took up residence two years ago at the Milan Arsenal.\n\nPaul Lefebvre of the U.S. Department of the Interior, which is also working on the plan, said yesterday that the birds would be sprayed with two chemicals, resulting in a rapid loss of body heat. This will be done on a night with sub-freezing temperatures, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is an elementary school, P.S. 421, across the street from my building. The board of education is busing children from the bad areas of the city to P.S. 421 (our area is thought to be a good area) and busing children from P.S. 421 to schools in the bad areas, in order to achieve racial balance in the schools. The parents of the P.S. 421 children do not like this very much, but they are all good citizens and feel it must be done. The parents of the children in the bad areas may not like it much, either, having their children so far from home, but they too probably feel that the process makes somehow for a better education. Every morning the green buses arrive in front of the school, some bringing black and Puerto Rican children to P.S. 421 and others taking the local, mostly white, children away. Presiding over all this is the loadmaster.\n\nThe loadmaster is a heavy, middle-aged white woman, not fat but heavy, who wears a blue cloth coat and a scarf around her head and carries a clipboard. She gets the children into and out of the buses, briskly, briskly, shouting, \"Let's go, let's go, let's go!\" She has a voice that is louder than the voices of forty children. She gets a bus filled up, gives her clipboard a fast once-over, and sends the driver on his way: \"O.K., Jose.\" The bus has been parked in the middle of the street, and there is a long line of hungup cars behind it, unable to pass, their drivers blowing their horns impatiently. When the drivers of these cars honk their horns too vigorously, the loadmaster steps away from the bus and yells at them in a voice louder than fourteen stacked-up drivers blowing their horns all at once: \"Keep your pants on!\" Then to the bus driver: \"O.K., Jose.\" As the bus starts off, she stands back and gives it an authoritative smack on its rump (much like a coach sending a fresh player into the game) as it passes. Then she waves the stacked-up drivers on their way, one authoritative wave for each driver. She is making authoritative motions long after there is any necessity for it.\n\n\n\nMy grandfather once fell in love with a dryad -- a wood nymph who lives in trees and to whom trees are sacred and who dances around trees clad in fine leaf-green tutu and who carries a great silver-shining ax to whack anybody who does any kind of thing inimical to the well-being and mental health of trees. My grandfather was at that time in the lumber business.\n\nIt was during the Great War. He'd got an order for a million board feet of one-by-ten of the very poorest quality, to make barracks out of for the soldiers. The specifications called for the dark red sap to be running off it in buckets and for the warp on it to be like the tops of waves in a distressed sea and for the knotholes in it to be the size of an intelligent man's head for the cold wind to whistle through and toughen up the (as they were then called) doughboys.\n\nMy grandfather headed for East Texas. He had the timber rights to ten thousand acres there, Southern yellow pine of the loblolly family. It was third-growth scrub and slash and shoddy--just the thing for soldiers. Couldn't be beat. So he and his men set up operations and first crack out of the box they were surrounded by threescore of lovely dryads and hamadryads all clad in fine leaf-green tutus and waving great silver-shining axes.\n\n\"Well now,\" my grandfather said to the head dryad, \"wait a while, wait a while, somebody could get hurt.\"\n\n\"That is for sure,\" says the girl, and she shifts her ax from her left hand to her right hand.\n\n\"I thought you dryads were indigenous to oak,\" says my grandfather, \"this here is pine.\"\n\n\"Some like the ancient tall-standing many-branched oak,\" says the girl, \"and some the white-slim birch, and some take what they can get, and you will look mighty funny without any legs on you.\"\n\n\"Can we negotiate,\" says my grandfather, \"it's for the War, and you are the loveliest thing I ever did see, and what is your name?\"\n\n\"Megwind,\" says the girl, \"and also Sophie. I am Sophie in the night and Megwind in the day and I make fine whistling ax-music night or day and without legs for walking your life's journey will be a pitiable one.\"\n\n\"Well Sophie,\" says my grandfather, \"let us sit down under this tree here and open a bottle of this fine rotgut here and talk the thing over like reasonable human beings.\"\n\n\"Do not use my night-name in the light of day,\" says the girl, \"and I am not a human being and there is nothing to talk over and what type of rotgut is it you have there?\"\n\n\"It is Teamster's Early Grave,\" says my grandfather, \"and you'll cover many a mile before you find the beat of it.\"\n\n\"I will have one cupful,\" says the girl, \"and my sisters will each have one cupful, and then we will dance around this tree while you still have legs for dancing and they you will go away and your men also.\"\n\n\"Drink up,\" says my grandfather, \"and know that of all the women I have interfered with in my time you are the absolute top woman.\"\n\n\"I am not a woman,\" says Megwind, \"I am a spirit, although the form of the thing is misleading I will admit.\"\n\n\"Wait a while,\" says my grandfather, \"you mean that no type of mutual interference between us of a physical nature is possible?\"\n\n\"That is a thing I could do,\" says the girl, \"if I chose.\"\n\n\"Do you choose?\" asks my grandfather, \"and have another wallop.\"\n\n\"That is a thing I will do,\" says the girl, and she has another wallop.\n\n\"And a kiss,\" says my grandfather, \"would that be possible do you think?\"\n\n\"That is a thing I could do,\" says the dryad, \"you are not the least prepossessing of men and men have been scarce in these parts in these years, the trees being as you see mostly scrub, slash, and shoddy.\"\n\n\"Megwind,\" says my grandfather, \"you are beautiful.\"\n\n\"You are taken with my form which I admit is beautiful,\" says the girl, \"but know that this form you see is not necessary but contingent, sometimes I am a fine brown-speckled egg and sometimes I am an escape of steam from a hole in the ground and sometimes I am an armadillo.\"\n\n\"That is amazing,\" says my grandfather, \"a shape-shifter are you.\"\n\n\"That is a thing I could do,\" says Megwind, \"if I choose.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" says my grandfather, \"could you change yourself into one million board feet of one-by-ten of the very poorest quality neatly stacked in railroad cars on a siding outside of Fort Riley, Kansas?\"\n\n\"That is a thing I could do,\" says the girl, \"but I do not see the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"The beauty of it,\" says my grandfather, \"is two cents a board foot.\"\n\n\"What is the quid pro quo?\", asks the girl.\n\n\"You mean spirits engage in haggle?\" asks my grandfather.\n\n\"Nothing from nothing, nothing for nothing, that is a law of life,\" says the girl.\n\n\"The quid pro quo,\" says my grandfather, \"is that me and my men will leave this here scrub, slash, and shoddy standing. All you have to do is to be made into barracks for the soldiers and after the War you will be torn down and can fly away home.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" says the dryad, \"but what about this interference of a physical nature you mentioned earlier? For the sun is falling down and soon I will be Sophie and human men have been scarce in these parts for ever so damn long.\"\n\n\"Sophie,\" says my grandfather, \"you are as lovely as light and let me just fetch another bottle from the truck and I will be at your service.\"\n\nThis is not really how it went. I am fantasizing. Actually, he just plain cut down the trees.\n\n\n\nI was on an operating table. My feet were in sterile bags. My hands and arms were wrapped in sterile towels. A sterile bib covered my beard. A giant six-eyed light was shining in my eyes. I closed my eyes. There was a doctor on the right side of my head and a doctor on the left side of my head. The doctor on the right was my doctor. The doctor on the left was studying the art. He was Chinese, the doctor on the left. My doctor spoke to the nurse who was handing him tools. \"Rebecca! You're not supposed to be holding conversations with the circulating nurse, Rebecca. You're supposed to be watching me, Rebecca!\" We had all gathered here in this room to cut out part of my upper lip, into which a basal-cell malignancy had crept.\n\nIn my mind, the basal-cell malignancy resembled a tiny truffle.\n\n\"Most often occurs in sailors and farmers,\" the doctor had told me. \"The sun.\" But I, I sit under General Electric light, mostly. \"We figure you can lose up to a third of it, the lip, without a bad result,\" the doctor had told me. \"There's a lot of stretch.\" He had demonstrated upon his own upper lip, stretching it with his two forefingers. The doctor a large handsome man with silver spectacles. In my hospital room, I listened to my Toshiba transistor, Randy Newman singing \"Let's Burn Down the Cornfield.\" I was waiting for the morning, for the operation. A friendly Franciscan entered in his brown robes. \"Why is it that in the space under 'Religion' on your form you entered 'None'?\" he asked in a friendly way. I considered the question. I rehearsed for him my religious history. We discussed the distinguishing characteristics of the various religious orders--the Basilians, the Capuchins. Recent outbreaks of Enthusiasm among the Dutch Catholics were touched upon. \"Rebecca!\" the doctor said, in the operating room. \"Watch me, Rebecca!\"\n\nI had been given a morphine shot along with various locals in the lip. I was feeling very good! The Franciscan had lived in the Far East for a long time. I too had been in the Far East. The Army band had played, as we climbed the ramp into the hold of the troopship, \"Bye Bye Baby, Don't Forget That You're My Baby.\" \"We want a good result,\" my original doctor had said, \"because of the prominence of the--\" He pointed to my upper lip. \"So I'm sending you to a good man.\" This seemed sensible. I opened my eyes. The bright light. \"Give me a No. 10 blade,\" the doctor said. \"Give me a No. 15 blade.\" Something was certainly going on there, above my teeth. \"Gently, gently,\" my doctor said to his colleague. The next morning a tiny Thai nurse came in bringing me orange juice, orange Jell-O, and an orange broth. \"Is there any pain?\" she asked.\n\nMy truffle was taken to the pathologist for examination. I felt the morphine making me happy. I thought: What a beautiful hospital.\n\nA handsome nurse from Jamaica came in. \"Now you put this on,\" she said, handing me a wrinkled white garment without much back to it. \"No socks. No shorts.\"\n\nNo shorts!\n\nI climbed onto a large moving bed and was wheeled to the operating table, where the doctors were preparing themselves for the improvement of my face. My doctor invited the Chinese doctor to join him in a scrub. I was eating my orange Jell-O, my orange broth. My wife called and said that she had eaten a superb Beef Wellington for diner, along with a good bottle. Every time I smiled the stitches jerked tight.\n\nI was standing outside the cashier's window. I had my pants on and was feeling very dancy. \"Udbye!\" I said. \"Hank you!\"\n\n* * *\n\nI went to a party. I saw a lady I knew. \"Hello!\" I said. \"Are you pregnant?\" She was wearing what appeared to be maternity clothes.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I am not.\"\n\n\"Cab!\"\n\n\n\nBut where are you today?\n\nProbably out with your husband for a walk. He has written another beautiful poem, and needs the refreshment of the air. I admire him. Everything he does is successful. He is wanted for lectures in East St. Louis, at immense fees. I admire him, but my admiration for you is... Do you think he has noticed? What foolishness! It is as obvious as a bumper sticker, as obvious as an abdication.\n\nYour Royal Canadian Mounted Police hat set squarely across the wide white brow...\n\nYour white legs touching each other, under the banquet table...\n\nProbably you are walking with your husband in SoHo, seeing what the new artists are refusing to do there, in their quest for a scratch to start from.\n\nThe artists regard your brown campaign hat, your white legs. \"Holy God!\" they say, and return to their lofts.\n\nI have spent many message units seeking your voice, but I always get Frederick instead.\n\n\"Well, Frederick,\" I ask cordially, \"what amazing triumphs have you accomplished today?\"\n\nHe has been offered a sinecure at Stanford and a cenotaph at CCNY. Bidding for world rights to his breath has begun at $500,000.\n\nBut I am wondering--\n\nWhen you placed your hand on my napkin, at the banquet, did that mean anything?\n\nWhen you smashed in the top of my soft-boiled egg for me, at the banquet, did that indicate that I might continue to hope?\n\nI will name certain children after you. (People often ask my advice about naming things.) It will be suspicious, so many small Philippas popping up in our city, but the pattern will become visible only with the passage of time, and in the interval, what satisfaction!\n\nI cannot imagine the future. You have not made your intentions clear, if indeed you have any. Now you are climbing aboard a great ship, and the hawsers are being loosed, and the flowers in the cabins arranged, and the dinner gong sounded...."

    "alltxt": "\n\n\nEdgar was preparing to take the National Writer's Examination, a five-hour fifty-minute examination, for his certificate. He was in his room, frightened. The prospect of taking the exam again put him in worlds of hurt. He had taken it twice before, with evil results. Now he was studying a book which contained not the actual questions from the examination but similar questions. \"Barbara, if I don't knock it for a loop this time I don't know what we'll do.\" Barbara continued to address herself to the ironing board. Edgar thought about saying something to his younger child, his two-year-old daughter, Rose, who was wearing a white terry-cloth belted bathrobe and looked like a tiny fighter about to climb into the ring. They were all in the room while he was studying for the examination.\n\n\"The written part is where I fall down,\" Edgar said morosely, to everyone in the room. \"The oral part is where I do best.\" He looked at the back of his wife which was pointed to him. \"If I don't kick it in the head this time I don't know what we're going to do,\" he repeated. \"Barb?\" But she failed to respond to this implied question. She felt it was a false hope, taking this examination which he had already failed miserably twice and which always got him very worked up, black with fear, before he took it. Now she didn't wish to witness the spectacle any more so she gave him her back.\n\n\"The oral part,\" Edgar continued encouragingly, \"is A-okay. I can for instance give you a list of answers, I know it so well. Listen, here is an answer, can you tell me the question?\" Barbara, who was very sexually attractive (that was what made Edgar tap on her for a date, many years before) but also deeply mean, said nothing. She put her mind on their silent child, Rose.\n\n\"Here is the answer,\" Edgar said. \"The answer is Julia Ward Howe. What is the question?\"\n\nThis answer was too provocative for Barbara to resist long, because she knew the question. \"Who wrote 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic'?\" she said. \"There is not a grown person in the United States who doesn't know that.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Edgar said unhappily, for he would have preferred that the answer had been a little more recherchÔøΩ, one that she would not have known the question to. But she had been a hooker for a period before their marriage and he could resort to this area if her triumph grew too great. \"Do you want to try another one?\"\n\n\"Edgar I don't believe in that examination any more,\" she told him coldly.\n\n\"I don't believe in you Barbara,\" he countered.\n\nThis remark filled her with remorse and anger. She considered momentarily letting him have one upside the head but fear prevented her from doing it so she turned her back again and thought about the vaunted certificate. With a certificate he could write for all the important and great periodicals, and there would be some money in the house for a change instead of what they got from his brother and the Unemployment.\n\n\"It isn't you who has to pass this National Writers' Examination,\" he shot past her. Then, to mollify, he gave her another answer. \"Brand, tuck, glave, claymore.\"\n\n\"Is that an answer?\" she asked from behind her back.\n\n\"It is indeed. What's the question?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she admitted, slightly pleased to be put back in a feminine position of not knowing.\n\n\"Those are four names for a sword. They're archaic.\"\n\n\"That's why I didn't know them, then.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" said Edgar with some malice, for Barbara was sometimes given to saying things that were obvious, just to fill the air. \"You put a word like that in now and then to freshen your line,\" he explained. \"Even though it's an old word, it's so old it's new. But you have to be careful, the context has to let people know what the thing is. You don't want to be simply obscure.\" He liked explaining the tricks of the trade to Barb, who made some show of interest in them.\n\n\"Do you want me to read you what I've written for the written part?\"\n\nBarb said yes, with a look of pain, for she still felt acutely what he was trying to do.\n\n\"This is the beginning,\" Edgar said, preparing his yellow manuscript paper.\n\n\"What is the title?\" Barbara asked. She had turned to face him.\n\n\"I haven't got a title yet,\" Edgar said. \"Okay, this is the beginning.\" He began to read aloud. In the town of A-, in the district of Y-, there lived a certain Madame A-, wife of that Baron A- who was in the service of the young Friedrich II of Prussia. The Baron, a man of uncommon ability, is chiefly remembered for his notorious and inexplicable blunder at the Battle of Kolin: by withdrawing the column under his command at a crucial moment in the fighting, he earned for himself the greatest part of the blame for Friedrich's defeat, which resulted in a loss, on the Prussian side, of 13,000 out of 33,000 men. Now as it happened, the chÔøΩteau in which Madame A- was sheltering lay not far from the battlefield, in fact, the removal of her husband's corps placed the chÔøΩteau itself in the gravest danger; and at the moment Madame A- learned, from a Captain Orsini, of her husband's death by his own hand, she was also told that a detachment of pandours, the brutal and much-feared Hungarian light irregular cavalry, was hammering at the chÔøΩteau gates.\"\n\nEdgar paused to breathe.\n\nBarb looked at him in some surprise. \"The beginning turns me on,\" she said. \"More that usual, I mean.\" She began to have some faint hope, and sat down on the sofabed.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Edgar said. \"Do you want me to read you the development?\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nEdgar drank some water from a glass near to hand.\n\n\"The man who brought this terrible news enjoyed a peculiar status in regard to the lady, he was her lover, and he was not. Giacomo Orsini, second son of a noble family of Siena, had as a young man a religious vocation. He had become a priest, not the grander sort of priest in the north of his country. Here befell him a singular misfortune. It was the pleasure of Friedrich Wilhelm I, father of the present ruler, to assemble, as it well known, the finest army in Europe. Tiny Prussia was unable to supply men in sufficient numbers to satisfy this ambition, his recruiters ranged over the whole of Europe, and those whom they could not persuade, with promises of liberal bounties, into the king's service, they kidnapped. Now Friedrich was above all else fond of very tall men, and had created, for his personal guard, a regiment of giants, much mocked at the time, but nonetheless a brave and formidable sight. It was the bad luck of the priest Orsini to be a very tall man, and of impressive mien and bearing withal; he was abducted straight from the altar, as he was saying mass, the Host in his hand-\"\n\n\"This is very exciting,\" Barb broke in, her eyes showing genuine pleasure and enthusiasm.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Edgar said, and continued his reading.\n\n\"-and served ten years in the regiment of giants. On the death of Friedrich Wilhelm, the regiment was disbanded, among other economies; but the former priest, by now habituated to military life, and even zestful for it, enlisted under the new young king, with the rank of captain.\"\n\n\"Is it historically accurate?\" Barbara asked.\n\n\"It does not contradict what is known,\" Edgar assured her.\n\n\"Assigned to the staff of Baron A-, and much in the latter's house in consequence, he was thrown in with the lovely Inge, Madame A-, a woman much younger than her husband, and possessed of many excellent qualities. A deep sympathy established itself between them, with this idiosyncrasy, that it was never pressed to a conclusion, on his part, or acknowledged in any way, on hers. But both were aware that it existed, and drew secret nourishment from it, and took much delight in the nearness, one to the other. But this pleasant state of affairs also had a melancholy aspect, for Ostini, although exerting the greatest restraint in the matter, nevertheless considered that he had, in even admitting to himself that he was in love with Madame A-, damaged his patron the Baron, whom he knew to be a just and honorable man, and one who had, moreover, done him many kindnesses. In this humor Orsini saw himself as a sort of jackal skulking about the periphery of his benefactor's domestic life, which had been harmonious and whole, but was now, in whatsoever slight degree, compromised.\"\n\nRose, the child, stood in her white bathrobe looking at her father who was talking for such a long time, and in such a dramatic shaking voice.\n\n\"The Baron, on his side, was not at all insensible of the passion that was present, as it were in a condition of latency, between his young wife and the handsome Sienese. In truth, his knowledge of their intercourse, which he imagined had ripened far beyond the point it had actually reached, had flung him headlong into a horrible crime: for his withholding of the decisive troops at Kolin, for which history has judged him so harshly, was neither an error of strategy nor a display of pusillanimity, but a willful act, having as its purpose the exposure of the chÔøΩteau, and thus the lovers, whom he had caused the be together there, to the blood-lust of the pandours. And as for his alleged suicide, that too was a cruel farce; he lived, in a hidden place.\"\n\nEdgar stopped.\n\n\"It's swift-moving,\" Barbara complimented.\n\n\"Well, do you want me to read you the end?\"\n\n\"The end? Is it the end already?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to read you the end?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I've got the end but I don't have the middle,\" Edgar said, a little ashamed.\n\n\"You don't have the middle?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to read you the end or don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, read me the end.\" The possibility of a semiprofessional apartment, which she had entertained briefly, was falling out of her head with this news, that there was no middle.\n\n\"The last paragraph is this:\n\n\"During these events Friedrich, to console himself for the debacle at Kolin, composed in his castle at Berlin a flute sonata, of which the critic Guilda has said, that it is not less lovely than the sonatas of Georg Philip Telemann.\"\n\n\"That's ironic,\" she said knowingly.\n\n\"Yes,\" Edgar agreed, impatient. He was as volatile as popcorn.\n\n\"But what about the middle?\"\n\n\"I don't have the middle!\" he thundered.\n\n\"Something has to happen between them, Inge and what's his name,\" she went on. Otherwise there's no story.\" Looking at her he thought: she is still streety although wearing her housewife gear. The child was a perfect love, however, and couldn't be told from the children of success.\n\nBarb then began telling a story she knew that had happened to a friend of hers. This girl had had an affair with a man and had become pregnant. The man had gone off to Seville, to see if hell was a city much like it, and she had spontaneously aborted, in Chicago. Then she had flown over to parley, and they had walked in the streets and visited elderly churches and like that. And the first church they went into, there was this tiny little white coffin covered with flowers, right in the sanctuary.\n\n\"Banal,\" Edgar pronounced.\n\nShe tried to think of another anecdote to deliver to him.\n\n\"I've got to get that certificate!\" he suddenly called out desperately.\n\n\"I don't think you can pass the National Writers' Examination with what you have on that paper,\" Barb said then, with great regret, because even though he was her husband she didn't want to him unnecessarily. But she had to tell the truth. \"Without a middle.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have been great, even with the certificate,\" he said.\n\n\"Your views would have become known. You would have been something.\"\n\nAt that moment the son manquÔøΩ entered the room. The son manquÔøΩ was eight feet tall and wore a serape woven out of two hundred transistor radios, all turned on and tuned to different stations. Just by looking at him you could hear Portland and Nogales, Mexico.\n\n\"No grass in the house?\"\n\nBarbara got the grass which was kept in one of those little yellow and red metal canisters made for sending film back to Eastman Kodak.\n\nEdgar tried to think of a way to badmouth this immense son leaning over him like a large blaring building. But he couldn't think of anything. Thinking of anything was beyond him. I sympathize. I myself have these problems. Endings are elusive, middles are nowhere to be found, but worst of all is to begin, to begin, to begin."

    "title": "The first thing the baby did wrong.....\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\nThe first thing the baby did wrong was to tear pages out of her books. So we made a rule that each time she tore a page out of a book she had to stay alone in her room for four hours, behind the closed door. She was tearing out about a page a day, in the beginning, and the rule worked fairly well, although the crying and screaming from behind the closed door were unnerving. We reasoned that that was the price you had to pay, or part of the price you had to pay. But then as her grip improved she got to tearing out two pages at a time, which meant eight hours alone in her room, behind the closed door, which just doubled the annoyance for everybody. But she wouldn't quit doing it. And then as time went on we began getting days when she tore out three or four pages, which put her alone in her room for as much as sixteen hours at a stretch, interfering with normal feeding and worrying my wife. But I felt that if you made a rule you had to stick to it, had to be consistent, otherwise they get the wrong idea. She was about fourteen months old or fifteen months old at that point. Often, of course, she'd go to sleep, after an hour or so of yelling, that was a mercy. Her room was very nice, with a nice wooden rocking horse and practically a hundred dolls and stuffed animals. Lots of things to do in that room if you used your time wisely, puzzles and things. Unfortunately sometimes when we opened the door we'd find that she'd torn more pages out of more books while she was inside, and these pages had to be added to the total, in fairness.\n\nThe baby's name was Born Dancin'. We gave the baby some of our wine, red, whites and blue, and spoke seriously to her. But it didn't do any good.\n\nI must say she got real clever. You'd come up to her where she was playing on the floor, in those rare times when she was out of her room, and there'd be a book there, open beside her, and you'd inspect it and it would look perfectly all right. And then you'd look closely and you'd find a page that had one little corner torn, could easily pass for ordinary wear-and-tear but I knew what she'd done, she'd torn off this little corner and swallowed it. So that had to count and it did. They will go to any lengths to thwart you. My wife said that maybe we were being too rigid and that the baby was losing weight. But I pointed out to her that the baby had a long life to live and had to live in a world with others, had to live in a world where there were many, many rules, and if you couldn't learn to play by the rules you were going to be left out in the cold with no character, shunned and ostracized by everyone. The longest we ever kept her in her room consecutive was eighty-eight hours, and that ended when my wife took the door off its hinges with a crowbar even though the baby still owed us twelve hours because she was working off twenty five pages. I put the door back on its hinges and added a big lock, one that opened only if you put a magnetic card in a slot, and I kept the card.\n\nBut things didn't improve. The baby would come out of her room like a bat out of hell and rush to the nearest book, Goodnight Moon or whatever, and begin tearing pages out of it hand over fist. I mean there'd be thirty-four pages of Goodnight Moon on the floor in ten seconds. Plus the covers. I began to get a little worried. When I added up her indebtedness, in terms of hours, I could see that she wasn't going to get out of her room until 1992, if then. Also, she was looking pretty wan. She hadn't been to the park in weeks. We had more or less of an ethical crisis on our hands.\n\nI solved it by declaring that it was all right to tear pages out of books, and moreover, that it was all right to have torn pages out of books in the past. That is one of the satisfying things about being a parent-you've got a lot of moves, each one good as gold. The baby and I sit happily on the floor, side by side, tearing pages out of books, and sometimes, just for fun, we go out on the street and smash a windshield together."

    "title": "The Great Hug\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\nAt the last breakfast after I told her, we had steak and eggs. Bloody Marys. Three pieces of toast. She couldn't cry she tried. Balloon Man came. He photographed the event. He created the Balloon of the Last Breakfast After I Told Her -- a butter- colored balloon. \"This is the kind of thing I do so well,\" he said. Balloon Man is not modest. No one has ever suggested that. \"This balloon is going to be extra-famous and acceptable, a documentation of raw human riches, the plain canvas gravy of the thing. The Pin Lady will never be able to bust this balloon, never, not even if she hugs me for a hundred years.\" We were happy to have pleased him, to have contributed to his career.\n\nThe Balloon Man won't sell to kids. Kids will come up to the Balloon Man and say, \"Give us a blue balloon, Balloon Man,\" and the Balloon Man will say, \"Get outa here kids, these balloons are adults-only.\" And the kids will say, \"C'mon, Balloon Man, give us a red balloon and a green balloon and a white balloon, we got the money.\" \"Don't want any kid-money,\" the Balloon Man will say, \"kid-money is wet and nasty and makes your hands wet and nasty and then you wipe 'em on your pants and your pants get all wet and nasty and you sit down to eat and the chair gets all wet and nasty, let that man in the brown hat draw near, he wants a balloon.\" And the kids will say, \"Oh please Balloon Man, we want five yellow balloons that never pop, we want to make us a smithereen.\" \"Ain't gonna make no smithereen outa my fine yellow balloons,\" says the Balloon Man, \"your red balloon will pop sooner and your green balloon will pop later but your yellow balloon will never pop no matter how you stomp on it or stick it and besides the Balloon Man don't sell to kids, it's against his principles.\"\n\nThe Balloon Man won't let you take his picture. He has something to hide. He's a superheavy Balloon Man, doesn't want the others to steal his moves. It's all in the gesture -- the precise, reunpremeditated right move.\n\nBalloon Man sells the Balloon of Fatigue and the Bal loon of Ora Pro Nobis and the Rune Balloon and the Balloon of the Last Thing to Do at Night; these are saffron-, cinnamon-, salt-, and celery-colored, respectively. He sells the Balloon of Not Yet and the Balloon of Sometimes. He works the circus, every circus. Some people don't go to the circus and so don't meet the Balloon Man and don't get to buy a balloon. That's sad. Near to most people in any given city at any given time won't be at the circus. That's unfortunate. They don't get to buy a brown, whole-life-long cherishable Sir Isaiah Berlin Balloon. \"I don't sell the Balloon Jejune,\" the Balloon Man will say, \"let them other people sell it, let them other people have all that wet and nasty kid-money mitosising in their sock. That a camera you got there mister? Get away.\" Balloon Man sells the Balloon of Those Things I Should Have Done I Did Not Do, a beige balloon. And the Balloon of the Ballade of the Crazy Junta, crimson of course. Balloon Man stands in a light rain near the popcorn pushing the Balloon of Wish I Was, the Balloon of Busoni Thinking, the Balloon of the Perforated Septum, the Balloon of Not Nice. Which one is my balloon, Balloon Man? Is it the Balloon of the Cartel of Noose Makers? Is it the Balloon of God Knows I Tried?\n\nOne day the Balloon Man will meet the Pin Lady. It's in the cards, in the stars, in the entrails of sacred animals. Pin Lady is a woman with pins stuck in her couture, rows of pins and pins not in rows but placed irregularly here a pin there a pin, maybe eight thousand pins stuck in her couture or maybe ten thousand pins or twelve thousand pins. Pin Lady tells the truth. The embrace of Balloon Man and Pin Lady will be something to see. They'll roll down the hill together, someday. Balloon Man's arms will be wrapped around Pin Lady's pins and Pin Lady's embrangle will be wrapped around Balloon Man's balloons -- even the yellow balloons. They'll roll down the hill together. Pin Lady has the Pin of I Violently Desire. She has the Pin of Crossed Fingers Behind My Back, she has the Pin of Soft Talk, she has the Pin of No More and she is rumored to have the Pin of the Dazed Sachem's Last Request She's into puncture. When puncture becomes widely accepted and praised, it will be the women who will have the sole license to perform it, Pin Lady says.\n\nPin Lady has the Pin of Tomorrow Night -- a wicked pin those who have seen it say. That great hug, when Balloon Man and Pin Lady roll down the hill together, will be frightening. The horses will run away in all directions Ordinary people will cover their heads with shopping bags. I don't want to think about it. You blow up all them balloons yourself, Balloon Man? Or did you have help? Pin Lady, how come you're so apricklededee? Was it something in your childhood?\n\nBalloon Man will lead off with the Balloon of Grace Under Pressure, Do Not Pierce or Incinerate.\n\nPin Lady will counter with the Pin of Oh My, I Forgot.\n\nBalloon Man will produce the Balloon of Almost Wonderful. Pin Lady will come back with the Pin of They Didn't Like Me Much. Balloon Man will sneak in there with the Balloon of the Last Exit Before the Toll Is Taken. Pin Lady will reply with the Pin of One Never Knows for Sure. Balloon Man will propose the Balloon of Better Days. Pin Lady, the Pin of Whiter Wine.\n\nIt's gonna be bad, I don't want to think about it.\n\nPin Lady tells the truth. Balloon Man doesn't lie, exactly. How can the Quibbling Balloon be called a lie? Pin Lady is more straightforward. Balloon Man is less straightforward. Their stances are semiantireprophetical. They're falling down the hill together, two falls out of three. Pin him, Pin Lady. Expand, Balloon Man. When he created our butter-colored balloon, we felt better. A little better. The event that had happened to us went floating out into the world, was made useful to others. Balloon Man says, \"I got here the Balloon of the Last Concert. It's not a bad balloon. Some people won't like it. Some people will like it. I got the Balloon of Too Terrible. Not every balloon can make you happy. Not every balloon can trigger glee. But I insist that these balloons have a right to be heard! Let that man in the black cloak step closer, he wants a balloon.\n\n\"The Balloon of Perhaps. My best balloon.\""

    "alltxt": "\n\n\nI wrote a letter to the President of the moon, asked him if they had towaway zones up there. The cops had towed away my Honda and I didn't like it. Cost me seventy-five dollars to get it back, plus the mental health. You ever notice how the tow trucks pick on little tiny cars? You ever seen them hauling off a Chrysler Imperial? No, you haven't.\n\nThe President of the moon replied most courteously that the moon had no towaway zones whatsoever. Mental health on the moon, he added, cost only a dollar.\n\nWell, I needed mental health real bad that week, so I wrote back saying I thought I could get there by the spring of '81, if the space shuttle fulfilled its porcelain promise, and to keep some mental health warm for me who needed it, and could I interest him in a bucket of ribs in red sauce? Which I would gladly carry on up there to him if he wished?\n\nThe President of the moon wrote back that he would be delighted to have a bucket of ribs in red sauce, and that his zip code, if I needed it, was 10011000000000.\n\nI cabled him that I'd bring some six-packs of Rolling Rock beer to drink with the ribs in red sauce, and, by the way, what was the apartment situation up there?\n\nIt was bad, he replied by platitudinum plate, apartments were running about a dollar a year, he knew that was high but what could he do? These were four-bedroom apartments, he said, with three baths, library, billiard room, root cellar, and terrace over- looking the Sea of Prosperity. Maybe he could get me a rent abatement, he said, 'cause of me being a friend of the moon.\n\nThe moon began to sound like a pretty nice place. I sent a dollar to the Space Shuttle Hurry-Up Fund.\n\nDrumming fiercely on a hollow log with a longitudinal slit tuned to moon frequencies, I asked him about employment, medical coverage, retirement benefits, tax shelterage, convenience cards, and Christmas Club accounts.\n\nThat's a roger, he moonbeamed back, a dollar covers it all, and if you don't have a dollar we'll lend you a dollar through the Greater Moon Development Mechanism.\n\nWhat about war and peace? I inquired by means of curly little ALGOL circuits I had knitted myself on my Apple computer.\n\nThe President of the moon answered (by MIRV'D metaphor) that ticktacktoe was about as far as they'd got in that direction, and about as far as they would go, if he had anything to say about it.\n\nI told him via flights of angels with special instructions that it looked to me like he had things pretty well in hand up there and would he by any chance consider being President of us? Part-time if need be?\n\nNo, he said (in a shower of used-car asteroids with blue-and-green bumper stickers), our Presidential campaigns seemed to damage the candidates, hurt them. They began hitting each other over the head with pneumatic Russians, or saying terminally silly things about the trees. He wouldn't mind being Dizzy Gillespie, he said."

    "title": "Me and Miss Mandible\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\n13 September\n\nMiss Mandible wants to make love to me but she hesitates because I am officially a child; I am, according to the records, according to the gradebook on her desk, according to the card index in the principal's office, eleven years old. There is a misconception here, one that I haven't quite managed to get cleared up yet. I am in fact thirty-five, I've been in the Army, I am six feet one, I have hair in the appropriate places, my voice is a baritone, I know very well what to do with Miss Mandible if she ever makes up her mind.\n\nIn the meantime we are studying common fractions. I could, of course, answer all the questions, or at least most of them (there are things I don't remember). But I prefer to sit in this too-small seat with the desktop cramping my thighs and examine the life around me. There are thirty-two in the class, which is launched every morning with the pledge of allegiance to the flag. My own allegiance, at the moment, is divided between Miss Mandible and Sue Ann Brownly, who sits across the aisle from me all day long and is, like Miss Mandible, a fool for love. Of the two I prefer, today, Sue Ann; although between eleven and eleven and a half (she refuses to reveal her exact age) she is clearly a woman, with a woman's disguised aggression and a woman's peculiar contradictions. Strangely neither she nor any of the other children seem to see any incongruity in my presence here.\n\n15 September\n\nHappily our geography text, which contains maps of all the principal land-masses of the world, is large enough to conceal my clandestine journal-keeping, accomplished in an ordinary black composition book. Every day I must wait until Geography to put down such thoughts as I may have had during the morning about my situation and my fellows. I have tried writing at other times and it does not work. Either the teacher is walking up and down the aisles (during this period, luckily, she sticks close to the map rack in the front of the room) or Bobby Vanderbilt, who sits behind me, is punching me in the kidneys and wanting to know what I am doing. Vanderbilt, I have found out from certain desultory conversations on the playground, is hung up on sports cars, a veteran consumer of Road & Track. This explains the continual roaring sounds which seem to emanate from his desk; he is reproducing a record album called Sounds of Sebring.\n\n19 September\n\nOnly I, at times (only at times), understand that somehow a mistake has been made, that I am in a place where I don't belong. It may be that Miss Mandible also knows this, at some level, but for reasons not fully understood by me she is going along with the game. When I was first assigned to this room I wanted to protest, the error seemed obvious, the stupidest principal could have seen it; but I have come to believe it was deliberate, that I have been betrayed again.\n\nNow it seems to make little difference. This life-role is as interesting as my former life- role, which was that of a claims adjuster for the Great Northern Insurance Company, a position which compelled me to spend my time amid the debris of our civilization: rumpled fenders, roofless sheds, gutted ware houses, smashed arms and legs. After ten years of this one has a tendency to see the world as a vast junkyard, looking at a man and seeing only his (potentially) mangled parts, entering a house only to trace the path of the inevitable fire. Therefore when I was installed here, although I knew an error had been made, I countenanced it, I was shrewd; I was aware that there might well be some kind of advantage to be gained from what seemed a disaster. The role of The Adjuster teaches one much.\n\n22 September\n\nI am being solicited for the volleyball team. I decline, refusing to take unfair profit from my height.\n\n23 September\n\nEvery morning the roll is called: Bestvina, Bokenfohr, Broan, Brownly, Cone, Coyle, Crecelius, Darin, Durbin, Geiger, Guis wite, Heckler, Jacobs, Kleinschmidt, Lay, Logan, Masei, Mit gang, Pfeilsticker. It is like the litany chanted in the dim miserable dawns of Texas by the cadre sergeant of our basic training company.\n\nIn the Army, too, I was ever so slightly awry. It took me a fantastically long time to realize what the others grasped almost at once: that much of what we were doing was abso lutely pointless, to no purpose. I kept wondering why. Then something happened that proposed a new question. One day we were commanded to whitewash, from the ground to the topmost leaves, all of the trees in our training area. The corporal who relayed the order was nervous and apologetic. Later an off-duty captain sauntered by and watched us, white splashed and totally weary, strung out among the freakish shapes we had created. He walked away swearing. I understood the principle (orders are orders), but I wondered: Who decides?\n\n29 September\n\nSue Ann is a wonder. Yesterday she viciously kicked my ankle for not paying attention when she was attempting to pass me a note during History. It is swollen still. But Miss Mandible was watching me, there was nothing I could do. Oddly enough Sue Ann reminds me of the wife I had in my former role, while Miss Mandible seems to be a child. She watches me constantly, trying to keep sexual significance out of her look; I am afraid the other children have noticed. I have already heard, on that ghostly frequency that is the medium of class room communication, the words \"Teacher's pet!\"\n\n2 October\n\nSometimes I speculate on the exact nature of the conspiracy which brought me here. At times I believe it was instigated by my wife of former days, whose name was . . . I am only pretending to forget. I know her name very well, as well as I know the name of my former motor oil (Quaker State) or my old Army serial number (US 54109268). Her name was Brenda, and the conversation I recall best, the one which makes me suspicious now, took place on the day we parted. \"You have the soul of a whore,\" I said on that occasion, stating nothing less than literal, unvarnished fact. \"You,\" she replied, \"are a pimp, a poop, and a child. I am leaving you forever and I trust that without me you will perish of your own inadequacies. Which are considerable.\"\n\nI squirm in my seat at the memory of this conversation, and Sue Ann watches me with malign compassion. She has noticed the discrepancy between the size of my desk and my own size, but apparently sees it only as a token of my glamour, my dark man-of -the-world-ness.\n\n7 October\n\nOnce I tiptoed up to Miss Mandible's desk (when there was no one else in the room) and examined its surface. Miss Mandible is a clean-desk teacher, I discovered. There was nothing except her gradebook (the one in which I exist as a sixth grader) and a text, which was open at a page headed Making the Processes Meaningful. I read: \"Many pupils enjoy working fractions when they understand what they are doing. They have confidence in their ability to take the right steps and to obtain correct answers. However, to give the subject full social significance, it is necessary that many realistic situations requiring the processes be found. Many interesting and lifelike problems involving the use of fractions should be solved . . .\"\n\n8 October\n\nI am not irritated by the feeling of having been through all this before. Things are done differently now. The children, moreover, are in some ways different from those who accom panied me on my first voyage through the elementary schools: \"They have confidence in their ability to take the right steps and to obtain correct answers.\" This is surely true. When Bobby Vanderbilt, who sits behind me and has the great ta tical advantage of being able to maneuver in my disproportionate shadow, wishes to bust a classmate in the mouth he first asks Miss Mandible to lower the blind, saying that the sun hurts his eyes. When she does so, bip! My generation would never have been able to con authority so easily.\n\n13 October\n\nIt may be that on my first trip through the schools I was too much under the impression that what the authorities (who decides?) had ordained for me was right and proper, that I confused authority with life itself. My path was not particularly of my own choosing. My career stretched out in front of me like a paper chase, and my role was to pick up the clues. When I got out of school, the first time, I felt that this estimate was substantially correct, and eagerly entered the hunt. I found clues abundant: diplomas, membership cards, campaign buttons, a marriage license, insurance forms, discharge papers, tax returns, Certificates of Merit. They seemed to prove, at the very least, that I was in the running. But that was before my tragic mistake on the Mrs. Anton Bichek claim.\n\nI misread a clue. Do not misunderstand me: it was a tragedy only from the point of view of the authorities. I conceived that it was my duty to obtain satisfaction for the injured, for this elderly lady (not even one of our policyholders, but a claimant against Big Ben Transfer & Storage, Inc.) from the company. The settlement was $165,000; the claim, I still believe, was just. But without my encouragement Mrs. Bichek would never have had the self-love to prize her injury so highly. The company paid, but its faith in me, in my efficacy in the role, was broken. Henry Goodykind, the district manager, expressed this thought in a few not altogether unsympathetic words, and told me at the same time that I was to have a new role. The next thing I knew I was here, at Horace Greeley Elementary, under the lubricious eye of Miss Mandible.\n\n17 October\n\nToday we are to have a fire drill. I know this because I am a Fire Marshal, not only for our room but for the entire right wing of the second floor. This distinction, which was awarded shortly after my arrival, is interpreted by some as another mark of my somewhat dubious relations with our teacher. My armband, which is red and decorated with white felt letters reading FIRE, sits on the little shelf under my desk, next to the brown paper bag containing the lunch I carefully make for myself each morning. One of the advantages of packing my own lunch (I have no one to pack it for me) is that I am able to fill it with things I enjoy. The peanut butter sandwiches that my mother made in my former existence, many years ago, have been banished in favor of ham and cheese. I have found that my diet has mysteriously adjusted to my new situation; I no longer drink, for instance, and when I smoke, it is in the boys' john, like everybody else. When school is out I hardly smoke at all. It is only in the matter of sex that I feel my own true age; this is apparently something that, once learned, can never be forgotten. I live in fear that Miss Mandible will one day keep me after school, and when we are alone, create a compromising situation. To avoid this I have become a model pupil: another reason for the pronounced dislike I have encountered in certain quarters. But I cannot deny that I am singed by those long glances from the vicinity of the chalkboard; Miss Mandible is in many ways, notably about the bust, a very tasty piece.\n\n24 October\n\nThere are isolated challenges to my largeness, to my dimly realized position in the class as Gulliver. Most of my classmates are polite about this matter, as they would be if I had only one eye, or wasted, metal-wrapped legs. I am viewed as a mutation of some sort but essentially a peer. However Harry Broan, whose father has made himself rich manufacturing the Broan Bathroom Vent (with which Harry is frequently reproached; he is always being asked how things are in Ventsville), today inquired if I wanted to fight. An interested group of his followers had gathered to observe this suicidal under taking. I replied that I didn't feel quite up to it, for which he was obviously grateful. We are now friends forever. He has given me to understand privately that he can get me all the bathroom vents I will ever need, at a ridiculously modest figure.\n\n25 October\n\n\"Many interesting and lifelike problems involving the use of fractions should be solved . . .\" The theorists fail to realize that everything that is either interesting or lifelike in the class room proceeds from what they would probably call interpersonal relations: Sue Ann Brownly kicking me in the ankle. How lifelike, how womanlike, is her tender solicitude after the deed! Her pride in my newly acquired limp is transparent; everyone knows that she has set her mark upon me, that it is a victory in her unequal struggle with Miss Mandible for my great, overgrown heart. Even Miss Mandible knows, and counters in perhaps the only way she can, with sarcasm. \"Are you wounded, Joseph?\" Conflagrations smolder behind her eyelids, yearning for the Fire Marshal clouds her eyes. I mumble that I have bumped my leg.\n\n30 October\n\nI return again and again to the problem of my future.\n\n4 November\n\nThe underground circulating library has brought me a copy of Movie-TV Secrets, the multicolor cover blazoned with the headline \"Debbie's Date Insults Liz!\" It is a gift from Frankie Randolph, a rather plain girl who until today has had not one word for me, passed on via Bobby Vanderbilt. I nod and smile over my shoulder in acknowledgment; Frankie hides her head under her desk. I have seen these magazines being passed around among the girls (sometimes one of the boys will condescend to inspect a particularly lurid cover). Miss Mandible confiscates them whenever she finds one. I leaf through Movie-TV Secrets and get an eyeful. \"The exclusive picture on these pages isn't what it seems. We know how it looks and we know what the gossipers will do. So in the interests of a nice guy, we're publishing the facts first. Here's what really happened!\" The picture shows a rising young movie idol in bed, pajama-ed and bleary-eyed, while an equally blowzy young woman looks startled beside him. I am happy to know that the picture is not really what it seems; it seems to be nothing less than divorce evidence.\n\nWhat do these hipless eleven-year-olds think when they come across, in the same magazine, the full-page ad for Maurice de Paree, which features \"Hip Helpers\" or what appear to be padded rumps? (\"A real undercover agent that adds appeal to those hips and derriere, both!\") If they cannot decipher the language the illustrations leave nothing to the imagination. \"Drive him frantic . . .\" the copy continues. Perhaps this explains Bobby Vanderbilt's preoccupation with Lancias and Maseratis; it is a defense against being driven frantic.\n\nSue Ann has observed Frankie Randolph's overture, and catching my eye, she pulls from her satchel no less than seventeen of these magazines, thrusting them at me as if to prove that anything any of her rivals has to offer, she can top. I shuffle through them quickly, noting the broad editorial perspective:\n\n\"Debbie's Kids Are Crying\"\n \"Eddie Asks Debbie: Will You . . . ?\"\n \"The Nightmares Liz Has About Eddie!\"\n \"The Things Debbie Can Tell About Eddie\"\n \"The Private Life of Eddie and Liz\"\n \"Debbie Gets Her Man Back?\"\n \"A New Life for Liz\"\n \"Love Is a Tricky Affair\"\n \"Eddie's Taylor-Made Love Nest\"\n \"How Liz Made a Man of Eddie\"\n \"Are They Planning to Live Together?\"\n \"Isn't It Time to Stop Kicking Debbie Around?\"\n \"Debbie's Dilemma\"\n \"Eddie Becomes a Father Again\"\n \"Is Debbie Planning to Re-wed?\"\n \"Can Liz Fulfill Herself?\"\n \"Why Debbie Is Sick of Hollywood\"\n\n\nWho are these people, Debbie, Eddie, Liz, and how did they get themselves in such a terrible predicament? Sue Ann knows, I am sure; it is obvious that she has been studying their history as a guide to what she may expect when she is suddenly freed from this drab, flat classroom.\n\nI am angry and I shove the magazines back at her with not even a whisper of thanks.\n\n5 November\n\nThe sixth grade at Horace Greeley Elementary is a furnace of love, love, love. Today it is raining, but inside the air is heavy and tense with passion. Sue Ann is absent; I suspect that yesterday's exchange has driven her to her bed. Guilt hangs about me. She is not responsible, I know, for what she reads, for the models proposed to her by a venal publishing industry; I should not have been so harsh. Perhaps it is only the flu.\n\nNowhere have I encountered an atmosphere as charged with aborted sexuality as this. Miss Mandible is helpless; nothing goes right today. Amos Darin has been found drawing a dirty picture in the cloakroom. Sad and inaccurate, it was offered not as a sign of something else but as an act of love in itself. It has excited even those who have not seen it, even those who saw but understood only that it was dirty. The room buzzes with imperfectly comprehended titillation. Amos stands by the door, waiting to be taken to the principal's office. He wavers between fear and enjoyment of his temporary celebrity. From time to time Miss Mandible looks at me reproachfully, as if blaming me for the uproar. But I did not create this atmosphere, I am caught in it like all the others.\n\n8 November\n\nEverything is promised my classmates and I, most of all the future. We accept the outrageous assurances without blinking.\n\n9 November\n\nI have finally found the nerve to petition for a larger desk. At recess I can hardly walk; my legs do not wish to uncoil themselves. Miss Mandible says she will take it up with the custodian. She is worried about the excellence of my themes. Have I, she asks, been receiving help? For an instant I am on the brink of telling her my story. Something, however, warns me not to attempt it. Here I am safe, I have a place; I do not wish to entrust myself once more to the whimsy of authority. I resolve to make my themes less excellent in the future.\n\n11 November\n\nA ruined marriage, a ruined adjusting career, a grim inter lude in the Army when I was almost not a person. This is the sum of my existence to date, a dismal total. Small wonder that re-education seemed my only hope. It is clear even to me that I need reworking in some fundamental way. How efficient is the society that provides thus for the salvage of its clinkers!\n\nPlucked from my unexamined life among other pleasant, desperate, money-making young Americans, thrown backward in space and time, I am beginning to understand how I went wrong, how we all go wrong. (Although this was far from the intention of those who sent me here; they require only that I get right.)\n\n14 November\n\nThe distinction between children and adults, while probably useful for some purposes, is at bottom a specious one, I feel. There are only individual egos, crazy for love.\n\n15 November\n\nThe custodian has informed Miss Mandible that our desks are all the correct size for sixth-graders, as specified by the Board of Estimate and furnished the schools by the Nu-Art Educational Supply Corporation of Englewood, California. He has pointed out that if the desk size is correct, then the pupil size must be incorrect. Miss Mandible, who has already arrived at this conclusion, refuses to press the matter further. I think I know why. An appeal to the administration might result in my removal from the class, in a transfer to some sort of setup for \"exceptional children.\" This would be a disaster of the first magnitude. To sit in a room with child geniuses (or, more likely, children who are \"retarded\") would shrivel me in a week. Let my experience here be that of the common run, I say; let me be, please God, typical.\n\n20 November\n\nWe read signs as promises. Miss Mandible understands by my great height, by my resonant vowels, that I will one day carry her off to bed. Sue Ann interprets these same signs to mean that I am unique among her male acquaintances, therefore most desirable, therefore her special property as is every thing that is Most Desirable. If neither of these propositions work out then life has broken faith with them.\n\nI myself, in my former existence, read the company motto (\"Here to Help in Time of Need\") as a description of the duty of the adjuster, drastically mislocating the company's deepest concerns. I believed that because I had obtained a wife who was made up of wife-signs (beauty, charm, softness, perfume, cookery) I had found love. Brenda, reading the same signs that have now misled Miss Mandible and Sue Ann Brownly, felt she had been promised that she would never be bored again. All of us, Miss Mandible, Sue Ann, myself, Brenda, Mr. Goodykind, still believe that the American flag betokens a kind of general righteousness.\n\nBut I say, looking about me in this incubator of future citizens, that signs are signs, and that some of them are lies. This is the great discovery of my time here.\n\n23 November\n\nIt may be that my experience as a child will save me after all. If only I can remain quietly in this classroom, making my notes while Napoleon plods through Russia in the droning voice of Harry Broan, reading aloud from our History text. All of the mysteries that perplexed me as an adult have their origins here, and one by one I am numbering them, exposing their roots. Miss Mandible will refuse to permit me to remain ungrown. Her hands rest on my shoulders too warmly, and for too long.\n\n7 December\n\nIt is the pledges that this place makes to me, pledges that cannot be redeemed, that confuse me later and make me feel I am not getting anywhere. Everything is presented as the result of some knowable process; if I wish to arrive at four I get there by way of two and two. If I wish to burn Moscow the route I must travel has already been marked out by another visitor. If, like Bobby Vanderbilt, I yearn for the wheel of the Lancia 2.4-liter coupe, I have only to go through the appropriate process, that is, get the money. And if it is money itself that I desire, I have only to make it. All of these goals are equally beautiful in the sight of the Board of Estimate; the proof is all around us, in the no-nonsense ugliness of this steel and glass building, in the straightline matter-of-factness with which Miss Mandible handles some of our less reputable wars. Who points out that arrangements sometimes slip, that errors are made, that signs are misread? \"They have confidence in their ability to take the right steps and to obtain correct answers.\" I take the right steps, obtain correct answers, and my wife leaves me for another man.\n\n8 December\n\nMy enlightenment is proceeding wonderfully.\n\n9 December\n\nDisaster once again. Tomorrow I am to be sent to a doctor, for observation. Sue Ann Brownly caught Miss Mandible and me in the cloakroom, during recess, and immediately threw a fit. For a moment I thought she was actually going to choke. She ran out of the room weeping, straight for the principal's office, certain now which of us was Debbie, which Eddie, which Liz. I am sorry to be the cause of her disillusionment, but I know that she will recover. Miss Mandible is ruined but fulfilled. Although she will be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, she seems at peace; her promise has been kept. She knows now that everything she has been told about life, about America, is true.\n\nI have tried to convince the school authorities that I am a minor only in a very special sense, that I am in fact mostly to blame -- but it does no good. They are as dense as ever. My contemporaries are astounded that I present myself as anything other than an innocent victim. Like the Old Guard marching through the Russian drifts, the class marches to the conclusion that truth is punishment.\n\nBobby Vanderbilt has given me his copy of Sounds of Sebring, in farewell."

    "title": "The Rise of Capitalism\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\nThe first thing I did was make a mistake. I thought I had understood capitalism, but what I had done was assume an attitude -- melancholy sadness -- toward it. This attitude is not correct. Fortunately your letter came, at that instant. \"Dear Rupert, I love you every day. You are the world, which is life. I love you I adore you I am crazy about you. Love, Marta.\" Reading between the lines, I understood your critique of my attitude toward capitalism. Always mindful that the critic must \"studiare da un punto di vista formalistico e semiologico il rapporto fra lingua di un testo e codificazione di un -- \" But here a big thumb smudges the text -- the thumb of capitalism, which we are all under. Darkness falls. My neighbor continues to commit suicide, once a fortnight. I have this suicides geared into my schedule because my role is to save him; once I was late and he spent two days unconscious on the floor. But now that I have understood that I have not understood capitalism, perhaps a less equivocal position toward it can be \"hammered out.\" My daughter demands more Mr. Bubble for her bath. The shrimp boats lower their nets. A book called Humorists of the 18th Century is published.\n\nCapitalism places every man in competition with his fellows for a share of the available wealth. A few people accumulate big piles, but most do not. The sense of community falls victim to this struggle. Increased abundance and prosperity are tied to growing \"productivity.\" A hierarchy of functionaries interposes itself between the people and the leadership. The good of the private corporation is seen as prior to the public good. The world market system tightens control in the capitalist countries and terrorizes the Third World. All things are manipulated to these ends. The King of Jordan sits at his ham radio, inviting strangers to the palace. I visit my assistant mistress. \"Well, Azalea,\" I say, sitting in the best chair, \"what has happened to you since my last visit?\" Azalea tells me what happened to her. She has covered a sofa, and written a novel. Jack has behaved badly. Roger has lost his job (replaced by an electric eye). Gigi's children are in the hospital being detoxified, all three. Azalea herself is dying of love. I stroke her buttocks, which are perfection, if you can have perfection, under the capitalistic system. \"It is better to marry that to burn,\" St. Paul says, but St. Paul is largely discredited now, for the toughness of his views does not accord with the experience of advanced industrial societies. I smoke a cigar, to disoblige the cat.\n\nMeanwhile Marta is getting angry. \"Rupert,\" she says, \"you are no better than a damn dawg! A plain dawg has more sensibility than you, when it comes to a woman's heart!\" I try to explain that it is not my fault but capitalism's. She will have none of it. \"I stand behind the capitalistic system,\" Martha says. \"It has given us everything we have -- the streets, the parks, the great avenues and boulevards, the promenades and malls -- and other things, too, that I can't think of right now.\" But what has the market been doing? I scan the list of the fifteen Most Loved Stocks:\n\nOccident Pet 983,100 28 5/8 + 3 ÔøΩ\n Natomas 912,300 58 3/8 + 18 ÔøΩ\n\nWhat chagrin! Why wasn't I into Natomas, as into a fine garment, that will win you social credit when you wear it to the ball? I am not rich again this morning! I put my head between Marta's breasts, to hide my shame.\n\nHonorÔøΩ de Balzac went to the movies. He was watching his favorite flick, The Rise of Capitalism, with Simone Simon and Raymond Radiguet. When he had finished viewing the film, he went out and bought a printing plant, for fifty thousand francs. \"Henceforth,\" he said, \"I will publish myself, in handsome expensive de-luxe editions, cheap editions, and foreign editions, duodecimo, sexdecimo, octodecimo. I will also publish atlases, stamp albums, collected sermons, volumes of sex education, remarks, memoirs, diaries, railroad timetables, daily newspapers, telephone books, racing forms, manifestos, libretti, abecedaries, works on acupuncture, and cookbooks.\" And then HonorÔøΩ went out and got drunk, and visited his girlfriend's house, and, roaring and stomping on the stairs, frightened her husband to death. And the husband was buried, and everyone stood silently around the grave, thinking of where they had been and where they were going, and the last handfuls of wet earth were cast upon the grave, and HonorÔøΩ was sorry.\n\nThe Achievements of Capitalism:\n\nThe curtain wall\nArtificial rain\nRockefeller Center\nCanals\nMystification\n\n\"Capitalism sure is sunny!\" cried the unemployed Laredo toolmaker, as I was out walking, in the streets of Laredo. \"None of that noxious Central European miserabilism for us!\" And indeed, everything I see about me seems to support his position. Laredo is doing very well now, thanks to application of the brilliant principles of the \"new capitalism.\" Its Gross Laredo Product is up, and its internal contradictions are down. Catfish-farming, a new initiative in the agribusiness sector, has worked wonders. The dram-house and the card-house are each nineteen stories high. \"No matter,\" Azalea says. \"You are still a damn dawg, even if you have 'unveiled existence.'\" At the Laredo Country Club, men and women are discussing the cathedrals of France, where all of them have just been. Some liked Tours, some Lyon, some Clermont. \"A pious fear of God makes itself felt in this spot.\"\n\nCapitalism arose and took off its pajamas. Another day, another dollar. Each man is valued at what he will bring in the marketplace. Meaning has been drained from work and assigned instead to remuneration. Unemployment obliterates the world of the unemployed individual. Cultural underdevelopment of the worker, as a technique of domination, is found everywhere under late capitalism. Authentic self-domination by individuals is thwarted. The false consciousness created and catered to by mass culture perpetuates ignorance and powerlessness. Strands of raven hair floating on the surface of the GangesÔøΩWhy can't they clean up the Ganges? If the wealthy capitalists who operate the Ganges wig factories could be forced to install sieves, at the mouths of their plantsÔøΩ And now the sacred Ganges is choked with hair, and the river no longer knows where to put its flow, and the moonlight on the Ganges is swallowed by the hair, and the water darkens. By Vishnu! This is an intolerable situation! Shouldn't something be done about it?\n\nFriends for dinner! The cruditÔøΩs are prepared, green and freshÔøΩ The good paper napkins are laid outÔøΩ Everyone is talking about capitalism (although some people are talking about the psychology of aging, and some about the human use of human beings, and some about the politics of experience). \"How con you say that?\" Azalea shouts, and Marta shouts, \"What about the air?\" As a flower moves toward the florist, women move toward men who are not good for them. Self-actualization is not to be achieved in terms of another person, but you don't know that, when you begin. The negation of the negation is based on a correct reading of the wrong books. The imminent heat-death of the universe is not a bad thing, because it is a long way off. Chaos is a position, but a weak one, related to that \"unfocusedness\" about which I have forgotten to speak. And now the saints come marching in, saint upon saint, to deliver their message! Here are St. Albert (who taught Thomas Aquinas), and St. Almachius (martyred trying to put an end to gladiatorial contests), and St. Amadour (the hermit), and St. Andrew of Crete (whose \"Great Kanon\" runs to two hundred and fifty strophes), and St. Anthony the Pillar, and many others. \"Listen!\" the saints say. \"He who desires true rest and happiness must raise his hope from things that perish and pass away and place it in the Word of God, so that, cleaving to that which abides forever, he may also together with it abide forever.\" Alas! It is the same old message. \"Rupert,\" Martha says, \"the embourgeoisment of all classes of men has reached a disgulting nadir in your case. A damn hawg has more sense than you. At least a damn hawg doesn't go in for 'the bullet wrapped in sugar,' as the Chinese say.\" She is right.\n\nSmoke, rain, abulia. What can the concerned citizen do to fight the rise of capitalism, in his own community? Study of the tides of conflict and power in a system in which there is structural inequality is an important task. A knowledge of European intellectual history since 1789 provides a useful background. Information theory offers interesting new possibilities. Passion is helpful, especially those types of passion which are non licit. Doubt is a necessary precondition to meaningful action. Fear is the great mover, in the end."

    "alltxt": "\n\n\nBecause he needed the money Peterson answered an ad that said \"We'll pay you to be on TV if your opinions are strong enough or your personal experiences have a flavor of unusual.\" He called the number and was told to come to Room 1551 in the Graybar Building on Lexington. This he did and after spending twenty minutes with a Miss Arbor who asked him if he had ever been in analysis was okeyed for a program called Who Am I? \"What do you have strong opinions about?\" Miss Arbor asked. \"Art,\" Peterson said, \"life, money.\" \"For instance?\" \"I believe,\" Peterson said, \"that the learning ability of mice can be lowered or increased by regulating the amount of serotonin in the brain. I believe that schizophrenics have a high incidence of unusual fingerprints, including lines that make almost complete circles. I believe that the dreamer watches his dream in sleep, by moving his eyes.\" \"That's very interesting!\" Miss Arbor cried. \"It's all in the World Almanac,\" Peterson replied.\n\n\"I see you're a sculptor,\" Miss Arbor said, \"that's wonderful.\" \"What is the nature of the program?\" Peterson asked. \"I've never seen it.\" \"Let me answer your question with another question,\" Miss Arbor said. \"Mr. Peterson, are you absurd?\" Her enormous lips were smeared with a glowing white cream. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I mean,\" Miss Arbor said earnestly, do you encounter your existence as gratuitous? Do you feel de trop? Is there nausea?\" \"I have enlarged liver,\" Peterson offered. \"That's excellent!\" Miss Arbor exclaimed. \"That's a very good beginning. Who Am I? tries, Mr. Peterson, to discover what people really are. People today, we feel, are hidden away inside themselves, alienated, desperate, living in anguish, despair and bad faith. Why have we been thrown here, and abandoned? That's the question we try to answer, Mr. Peterson. Man stands alone in a featureless, anonymous landscape, in fear and trembling and sickness unto death. God is dead. Nothingness everywhere. Dread. Estrangement. Finitude. Who Am I? approaches these problems in a root radical way.\" \"On television?\" \"We're interested in basics, Mr. Peterson. We don't play around.\" \"I see,\" Peterson said, wondering about the amount of the fee. \"What I wanted to know now, Mr. Peterson, is this: are you interested in absurdity?\" \"Miss Arbor,\" he said, \"to tell you the truth, I don't know. I'm not sure I believe in it.\" \"Oh, Mr. Peterson!\" Miss Arbor said, shocked. \"Don't say that! You'll be ...\" \"Punished?\" Peterson suggested. \"You may not\n\nbe interested in absurdity,\" she said, \"but absurdity is interested in you.\" \"I have a lot of problems, if that helps,\" Peterson said. \"Existence is problematic for you,\" Miss Arbor said, relieved. \"The fee is two hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"I'm going to be on television,\" Peterson said to his dealer. \"A terrible shame,\" Jean-Claude responded. \"Is it unavoidable?\" \"It's unavoidable,\" Peterson said, \"if I want to eat.\" \"How much?\" Jean-Claude asked and Peterson said: \"Two hundred.\" He looked around the gallery to see if any of his works were on display. \"A ridiculous compensation considering the infamy. Are you using your own name?\" \"You haven't by any chance ...\" \"No one is buying,\" Jean-Claude said. \"Undoubtedly it is the weather. People are thinking in terms of?what do you call those things??ChrisCrafts. To boat with. You would not consider again what I spoke to you about before?\" \"No,\" Peterson said, \"I wouldn't consider it.\" \"Two little ones would move much faster than a single huge big one,\" Jean-Claude said, looking away. \"To saw it across the middle would be a very simple matter.\" \"It's supposed to be a work of art,\" Peterson said, as calmly as possible. \"You don't go around sawing works of art across the middle, remember?\" \"That place where it saws,\" Jean-Claude said, \"is not very difficult. I can put my two hands around it.\" He made a circle with his two hands to demonstrate. \"Invariably when I look at that piece I see two pieces. A you absolutely sure you didn't conceive it wrongly in the first instance?\" \"Absolutely,\" Peterson said. Not a single piece of his was on view, and his liver expanded in rage and hatred. \"You have a very romantic impulse,\" Jean-Claude said. \"I admire, dimly, the posture. You read too much in the history of art. It estranges you from those possibilities for authentic selfhood that inhere in the present century.\" \"I know,\" Peterson said, \"could you let me have twenty until the first?\"\n\nPeterson sat in his loft on lower Broadway drinking Rheingold and thinking about the President. He had always felt close to the President but felt now that he had, in agreeing to appear on the television program, done something slightly disgraceful, of which the President would not approve. But I needed the money, he told himself, the telephone is turned off and the kitten is crying for milk. And I'm running out of beer. The President feels that the arts should be encouraged, Peterson reflected, surely he doesn't want me to go without beer? He wondered if what he was feeling was simple guilt at having sold himself to television or something more elegant: nausea? His liver groaned within him and he considered a situation in which his new relationship with the President was announced. He was working in the loft. The piece in hand was to be called Season's Greetings and combined three auto radiators, one from a Chevrolet Tudor, one from a Ford pickup, one from a 1932 Essex, with a part of a former telephone switchboard and other items. The arrangement seemed right and he began welding. After a time the mass was freestanding. A couple of hours had passed. He put down the torch, lifted off the mask. He walked over to the refrigerator and found a sandwich left by a friendly junk dealer. It was a sandwich made hastily and without inspiration: a thin slice of ham between two pieces of bread. He ate it gratefully nevertheless. He stood looking at the work, moving from time to time so as to view it from a new angle. Then the door to the loft burst open ran in, trailing a sixteen-pound sledge. His first blow cracked the principal weld in Season's Greetings, the two halves parting like lovers, clinging for a moment and then rushing off in opposite directions. Twelve Secret Service men held Peterson in a paralyzing combination of secret grips. He's looking good, Peterson thought, very good, healthy, mature, fit, trustworthy. I like his suit. The President's second and third blows smashed the Essex radiator and the Chevrolet radiator. Then he attacked the welding torch, the plaster sketches on the workbench, the Rodin cast and the Giacometti stickman Peterson had bought in Paris. \"But Mr. President!\" Peterson shouted. \"I thought we were friends!\" A Secret Service man bit him in the back of the neck. Then the President lifted the sledge high in the air, turned toward Peterson, and said: \"Your liver is diseased? That's a good sign. You're making progress. You're thinking.\"\n\n\"I happen to think that guy in the White House is doing a pretty darn good job.\" Peterson's barber, a man named Kitchen who was also a lay analyst and the author of four books titled The Decision to Be, was the only person in the world to whom he had confided his former sense of community with the President. \"As far as his relationship with you personally goes,\" the barber continued, \"it's essentially a kind of I-Thou relationship, if you know what I mean. You got to handle it with full awareness of the implications. In the end one experienced only oneself, Nietzsche said. When you're angry with the President, what you experience is self-as-angry-with-the-President. When things are okay between you and him, what you experience is self-as-swinging-with-the-President. Well and good. But,\" Kitchen said, lathering up, \"you want the relationship to be such that what you experience is the-President-as- swinging-with-you. You want his reality, get it? So that you can break out of the hell of solipsism. How about a little more off the sides?\" \"Everybody knows the language but me,\" Peterson said irritably. \"Look,\" Kitchen said, \"when you talk about me to somebody else, you say 'my barber,' don't you? Sure you do. In the same way, I look on you as being 'my customer,' get it? But you don't regard yourself as being 'my' customer and I don't regard myself as 'your' barber. Oh, it's hell all right.\" The razor moved like a switchblade across the back of Peterson's neck. \"Like Pascal said: 'The natural misfortune of our mortal and feeble condition is so wretched that when we consider it closely, nothing can console us.'\" The razor rocketed around an ear. \"Listen,\" Peterson said, \"what do you think of this television program called Who Am I? Ever seen it?\" \"Frankly,\" the barber said, \"it smells of the library. But they do a job on those people, I'll tell you that.\" \"What kind of a job?\" The cloth was whisked away and shaken with a sharp popping sound. \"It's too horrible even to talk about,\" Kitchen said. \"But it's what they deserve, those crumbs.\" \"Which crumbs?\" Peterson asked.\n\nThat night a tall foreign-looking man with a switchblade big as a butcher knife open in his hand walked into the loft without knocking and said \"Good evening, Mr. Peterson, I am the cat-piano player, is there anything you'd particularly like to hear?\" \"Cat-piano?\" Peterson said, gasping, shrinking from the knife. \"What are you talking about? What do you want?\" A biography of Nolde slid from his lap to the floor. \"The cat-piano,\" said the visitor, \"is an instrument of the devil, a diabolical instrument, You needn't sweat quite so much,\" he added, sounding aggrieved. Peterson tried to be brave. \"I don't understand,\" he said. \"Let me explain,\" the tall foreign-looking man said graciously. \"The keyboard consists of eight cats?the octave?encased in the body of the instrument in such a way that only their heads and forepaws protrude. The player presses upon the appropriate paws, and the appropriate cats respond?with a kind of shriek. There is also provision made for pulling their tails. A tail-puller, or perhaps I should say tail player\" (he smiled a disingenuous smile) \"is stationed at the rear of the instrument, where the tails are. At the correct moment the tail-puller pulls the correct tail. The tail-note is of course quite different from the paw-note and produces sounds in the upper register. Have you ever seen such an instrument, Mr. Peterson?\" \"No, and I don't believe it exists,\" Peterson said heroically. \"There is an excellent early seventeenth-century engraving by Franz van der Wyngaert, Mr. Peterson, in which a cat-piano appears. Played, as it happens, by a man with a wooden leg. You will observe my own leg.\" The cat-piano player hoisted his trousers and a leglike contraption of wood, metal and plastic appeared. \"And now, would you like to make a request? 'The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian'? The 'Romeo and Juliet' overture? 'Holiday for Strings'?\" \"But why?\" Peterson began. \"The kitten cries for milk, Mr. Peterson. And whenever a kitten cries, the cat-piano plays.\" \"But it's not my kitten,\" Peterson said reasonably. \"It's just a kitten that wished itself on me. I've been trying to give it away. I'm not sure it's still around. I haven't seen it since the day before yesterday.\" The kitten appeared, looked at Peterson reproachfully, and then rubbed itself against the cat-piano player's mechanical leg. \"Wait a minute!\" Peterson exclaimed. \"This thing is rigged! That cat hasn't been here in two days. What do you want from me? What am I supposed to do?\" \"Choices, Mr. Peterson, choices. You chose that kitten as a way of encountering that which you are not, that is to say, kitten. An effort on the part of the pour-soi to?\" \"But it chose me!\" Peterson cried, \"the door was open and the first thing I knew it was lying in my bed, under the Army blanket. I didn't have anything to do with it!\" The cat-piano player repeated his disingenuous smile. \"Yes, Mr. Peterson, I know, I know. Things are done to you, it is all a gigantic conspiracy. I've heard the story a hundred times. But the kitten is here , is it not? The kitten is it not?\" Peterson looked at the kitten, which was crying huge tigerish tears into its empty dish. \"Listen, Mr. Peterson,\" the cat-piano player said, \"listen!\" The blade of his immense knife jumped back into the handle with a twack! And the hideous music began.\n\nThe day after the hideous music began the three girls from California arrived. Peterson opened his door, hesitantly, in response to an insistent ringing, and found himself being stared at by three girls in blue jeans and heavy sweaters, carrying suitcases. \"I'm Sherry,\" the first girl said,\" \"and this is Ann and this is Louise. We're from California and we need a place to stay.\" They were homely and extremely purposeful. \"I'm sorry,\" Peterson said, \"I can't?\" \"We sleep anywhere,\" Sherry said, looking past him into the vastness of his loft, \"on the floor if we have to. We've done it before.\" Ann and Louise stood on their toes to get a good look. \"What's that funny music?\" Sherry asked, \"it sounds pretty far-out. We really won't be any trouble at all and it'll just be a little while until we make a connection.\" \"Yes,\" Peterson said, \"but why me?\" \"You're an artist,\" Sherry said sternly, \"we saw the AIR sign downstairs.\" Peterson cursed the fire laws which made posting of signs obligatory. \"Listen,\" he said, \"I can't even feed the cat. I can't even keep myself in beer. This is not the place. You won't be happy here. My work isn't authentic. I'm a minor artist.\" \"The natural misfortune of our mortal and feeble condition is so wretched that when we consider it closely, nothing can console us,\" Sherry said. \"That's Pascal.\" \"I know,\" Peterson said weakly. \"Where is the john?\" Louise asked. Ann marched into the kitchen and began to prepare, from supplies removed from her rucksack, something called veal engagÔøΩ. \"Kiss me,\" Sherry said, \"I need love.\" Peterson flew to his friendly neighborhood bar, ordered a double brandy, and thrust himself into a telephone booth. \"Miss Arbor? This is Hank Peterson. Listen, Miss Arbor, I can't do it. No, I mean really. I'm being punished horribly fir even thinking about it. No, I mean it. You can't imagine what's going on around here. Please, get somebody else? I'd regard it as a great personal favor. Miss Arbor? Please?\"\n\nThe other contestants were a young man in white pajamas named Arthur Pick, a karate expert, and an airline pilot in full uniform, Wallace E. Rice. \"Just be natural,\" said, \"and of course be frank. We score on the basis of the validity of your answers, and of course that's measured by the polygraph.\" \"What's this about a polygraph?\" the airline pilot. \"The polygraph measures the validity of your answers,\" Miss Arbor said, her lips glowing whitely. \"How else are we going to know if you're ...\" \"Lying?\" Wallace E. Rice supplied. The contestants were connected to the machine and the machine to a large illuminated tote board hanging over their heads. The master of ceremonies, Peterson noted without pleasure, resembled the President and did not look at all friendly.\n\nThe program began with Arthur Pick. Arthur Pick got up in his white pajamas and gave a karate demonstration in which he broke three half-inch pine boards with a single kick of his naked left foot. Then he told how he had disarmed a bandit, late at night at the A&P where he was an assistant manager, with a maneuver called a \"rip-choong\" which he demonstrated on the announcer. \"How about that?\" the announcer caroled. \"Isn't that something? Audience?\" The audience responded enthusiastically and Arthur Pick stood modestly with his hands behind his back. \"Now,\" the announcer said, \"let's play Who Am I? And here's your host, Bill Lemmon!\" No, he doesn't look like the President, Peterson decided. \"Arthur,\" Bill Lemmon said, \"for twenty dollars?do you love your mother?\" \"Yes,\" Arthur Pick said. \"Yes, of course.\" A bell rang, the tote board flashed, and the audience screamed. \"He's lying!\" the announcer shouted, \" lying! lying! lying!\" \"Arthur,\" Bill Lemmon said, looking at his index cards, \"the polygraph shows that the validity of your answer is ÔøΩ questionable. Would you like to try it again? Take another crack at it?\" \"You're crazy,\" Arthur Pick said. \"Of course I love my mother.\" He was fishing around inside his pajamas for a handkerchief. \"Is your mother watching the show tonight, Arthur?\" \"Yes, Bill, she is.\" \"How long have you been studying karate?\" \" Two years, Bill.\" \"And who paid for the lessons?\" Arthur Pick hesitated. Then he said: \"My mother, Bill.\" \"They were pretty expensive, weren't they, Arthur?\" \"Yes, Bill, they were.\" \"How expensive?\" \"Twelve dollars an hour.\" \"Your mother doesn't make very much money, does she, Arthur?\" \"No, Bill, she doesn't.\" \"Arthur, what does your mother do for a living?\" \"She's a garment worker, Bill. In the garment district.\" \"And how long has she worked down there?\" \"All her life, I guess. Since my old man died.\" \"And she doesn't make very much money, you said.\" \"No. But she wanted to pay for the lessons. She insisted on it.\" Bill Lemmon said: \"She wanted a son who could break boards with his feet?\" Peterson's liver leaped and the tote board spelled out, in huge, glowing white letters, the words BAD FAITH. The airline pilot, Wallace E. Rice. Was led to reveal that he had been caught, on a flight from Omaha to Miami, with a stewardess sitting on his lap and wearing his captain's cap, that the flight engineer had taken a Polaroid picture, and that he had been given involuntary retirement after nineteen years of faithful service. \"It was perfectly safe,\" Wallace E. Rice said, \"you don't understand, the automatic pilot can fly that plane better than I can.\" He further confessed to a lifelong and intolerable itch after stewardesses which had much to do, he said, with the way their jackets fell just on top of their hits, and his own jacket with the three gold stripes on the sleeve darkened with sweat until it was black.\n\nI was wrong, Peterson thought, the world is absurd. The absurdity is punishing me for not believing in it. I affirm the absurdity. On the other hand, absurdity is itself absurd. Before the emcee could ask the first question, Peterson began to talk. \"Yesterday,\" Peterson said to the television audience, \"in the typewriter in front of the Olivetti showroom on Fifth Avenue, I found a recipe for Ten Ingredient Soup that included a stone from a toad's head. And while I stood there marveling a nice old lady pasted on the elbow of my best Haspel suit a little blue sticker reading THIS INDIVIDUAL IS A PART OF THE COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY FOR GLOBAL DOMINATION OG THE ENTIRE GLOBE. Coming home I passed a sign that said in ten-foot letters COWARD SHOES and heard a man singing \"Golden earrings\" in a horrible voice, and last night i dreamed there was a shoot- out at our house on Meat Street and my mother shoved me in a closet to get me out of the line of fire.\" The emcee waved at the floor manager to turn Peterson off, but Peterson kept talking. \"In this kind of world,\" Peterson said, \"absurd if you will, possibilities nevertheless proliferate and escalate all around us and there are opportunities for beginning again. I am a minor artist and my dealer won't even display my work if he can help it but minor is as minor does and lightning may strike even yet. Don't be reconciled. Turn off your television sets,\" Peterson said, \"cash in your life insurance, indulge in a mindless optimism. Visit girls at dusk. Play the guitar. How can you be alienated without first having been connected? Think back and remember how it was.\" A man on the floor in front of Peterson was waving a piece of cardboard on which something threatening was written but Peterson ignored him and concentrated on the camera with the little red light. The little red light jumped from camera to camera in an attempt to throw him off balance but Peterson was too smart for it and followed wherever it went. \"My mother was a royal virgin,\" Peterson said, \"and my father a shower of gold. My childhood was pastoral and energetic and rich in experiences which developed my character. As a young man I was noble in reason, infinite in faculty, in form express and admirable, and in apprehension ÔøΩ\" Peterson went on and on and although he was, in a sense, lying, in a sense he was not."

    "title": "Some of Us Had Been Threatening Our Friend Colby\n by Donald Barthelme ",
    "alltxt": "\n\n\nSome of us had been threatening our friend Colby for a long time, because of the way he had been behaving. And now he'd gone too far, so we decided to hang him. Colby argued that just because he had gone too far (he did not deny that he had gone too far) did not mean that he should be subjected to hanging. Going too far, he said, was something everybody did sometimes. We didn't pay much attention to this argument. We asked him what sort of music he would like played at the hanging. He said he'd think about it but it would take him a while to decide. I pointed out that we'd have to know soon, because Howard, who is a conductor, would have to hire and rehearse the musicians and he couldn't begin until he knew what the music was going to be. Colby said he'd always been fond of Ives's Fourth Symphony. Howard said that this was a \"delaying tactic\" and that everybody knew that the Ives was almost impossible to perform and would involve weeks of rehearsal, and that the size of the orchestra and chorus would put us way over the music budget. \"Be reasonable,\" he said to Colby. Colby said he'd try to think of something a little less exacting.\n\nHugh was worried about the wording of the invitations. What if one of them fell into the hands of the authorities? Hanging Colby was doubtless against the law, and if the authorities learned in advance what the plan was they would very likely come in and try to mess everything up. I said that although hanging Colby was almost certainly against the law, we had a perfect moral right to do so because he was our friend, belonged to us in various important senses, and he had after all gone too far. We agreed that the invitations would be worded in such a way that the person invited could not know for sure what he was being invited to. We decided to refer to the event as \"An Event Involving Mr. Colby Williams.\" A handsome script was selected from a catalogue and we picked a cream-colored paper. Magnus said he'd see to having the invitations printed, and wondered whether we should serve drinks. Colby said he thought drinks would be nice but was worried about the expense. We told him kindly that the expense didn't matter, that we were after all his dear friends and if a group of his dear friends couldn't get together and do the thing with a little bit of eclat, why, what was the world coming to? Colbv asked if he would be able to have drinks, too, before the event. We said,\"Certainly.\"\n\nThe next item of business was the gibbet. None of us knew too much about gibbet design, but Tomas, who is an architect, said he'd look it up in old books and draw the plans. The important thing, as far as he recollected, was that the trapdoor function perfectly. He said that just roughly, counting labor and materials, it shouldn't run us more than four hundred dollars. \"Good God !\" Howard said. He said what was Tomas figuring on, rosewood? No, just a good grade of pine, Tomas said. Victor asked if unpainted pine wouldn't look kind of \"raw,\" and Tomas replied that he thought it could be stained a dark walnut without too much trouble.\n\nI said that although I thought the whole thing ought to be done really well and all, I also thought four hundred dollars for a gibbet, on top of the expense for the drinks, invitations, musicians, and everything, was a bit steep, and why didn't we just use a tree -- a nice-looking oak, or something? I pointed out that since it was going to be a June hanging the trees would be in glorious leaf and that not only would a tree add a kind of \"natural\" feeling but it was also strictly traditional, especially in the West. Tomas, who had been sketching gibbets on the backs of envelopes, reminded us that an outdoor hanging always had to contend with the threat of rain. Victor said he liked the idea of doing it outdoors, possibly on the bank of a river but noted that we would have to hold it some distance from the city, which presented the problem of getting the guests, musicians, etc., to the site and then back to town.\n\nAt this point everybody looked at Harry, who runs a car-and-truck-rental business. Harry said he thought he could round up enough limousines to take care of that end but that the drivers would have to be paid. The drivers, he pointed out, wouldn't be friends of Colby's and couldn't be expected to donate their services, any more than the bartender or the musicians. He said that he had about ten limousines, which he used mostly for funerals, and that he could probably obtain another dozen by calling around to friends of his in the trade. He said also that if we did it outside, in the open air, we'd better figure on a tent or awning of some kind to cover at least the principals and the orchestra, because if the hanging was being rained on he thought it would look kind of dismal. As between gibbet and tree, he said, he had no particular preferences and he really thought that the choice ought to be left up to Colby, since it was his hanging. Colby said that everybody went too far, sometimes, and weren't we being a little Draconian? Howard said rather sharply that all that had already been discussed, and which did he want, gibbet or tree? Colby asked if he could have a firing squad. No, Howard said, he could not. Howard said a firing squad would just be an ego trip for Colby, the blindfold and last-cigarette bit, and that Colby was in enough hot water already without trying to \"upstage\" everyone with unnecessary theatrics. Colby said he was sorry, he hadn't meant it that way, he'd take the tree. Tomas crumpled up the gibbet sketches he'd been making, in disgust.\n\nThen the question of the hangman came up. Pete said did we really need a hangman? Because if we used a tree, the noose could be adjusted to the appropriate level and Colby could just jump off something -- a chair or stool or something. Besides, Pete said, he very much doubted if there were any free-lance hangmen wandering around the country, now that capital punishment has been done away with absolutely, temporarily, and that we'd probably have to fly one in from England or Spain or one of the South American countries, and even if we did that how could we know in advance that the man was a professional, a real hangman, and not just some money-hungry amateur who might bungle the job and shame us all, in front of every body? We all agreed then that Colby should just jump off something and that a chair was not what he should jump off of, because that would look, we felt, extremely tacky -- some old kitchen chair sitting out there under our beautiful tree. Tomas, who is quite modern in outlook and not afraid of innovation, proposed that Colby be standing on a large round rubber ball ten feet in diameter. This, he said, would afford a sufficient \"drop\" and would also roll out of the way if Colby suddenly changed his mind after jumping off. He reminded us that by not using a regular hangman we were placing an awful lot of the responsibility for the success of the affair on Colby himself, and that although he was sure Colby would perform creditably and not disgrace his friends at the last minute, still, men have been known to get a little irresolute at times like that, and the ten-foot-round rubber ball, which could probably be fabricated rather cheaply, would insure a \"bang-up\" pro duction right down to the wire.\n\nAt the mention of \"wire,\" Hank, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke up and said he wondered if it wouldn't be better if we used wire instead of rope -- more efficient and in the end kinder to Colby, he suggested. Colby began looking a little green, and I didn't blame him, because there is something extremely distasteful in think ing about being hanged with wire instead of rope -- it gives you sort of a revulsion, when you think about it. I thought it was really quite unpleasant of Hank to be sitting there talking about wire, just when we had solved the problem of what Colby was going to jump off of so neatly, with Tomas's idea about the rubber ball, so I hastily said that wire was out of the question, because it would injure the tree -- cut into the branch it was tied to when Colby's full weight hit it -- and that in these days of increased respect for the environment, we didn't want that, did we? Colby gave me a grateful look, and the meeting broke up. Everything went off very smoothly on the day of the event (the music Colby finally picked was standard stuff, Elgar, and it was played very well by Howard and his boys). It didn't rain, the event was well attended, and we didn't run out of Scotch, or anything. The ten-foot rubber ball had been painted a deep green and blended in well with the bucolic setting. The two things I remember best about the whole episode are the grateful look Colby gave me when I said what I said about the wire, and the fact that nobody has ever gone too far again."
