# Donald Barthelme
That was a messy project -
I mainly learned how to scrape the web for content by Donald Barthelme.

## Process
I used puppeteer to scrape and store texts, some array & JSON manipulations to draw conclusions from the vocabulary without relating to the content, and youtube-dl to add content from an interview with George Plimpton.

At the end, I edited all in InDesign to a book anyone can print & bind at home (or at the office since it's 120 pages long).
